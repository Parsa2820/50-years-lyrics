Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing
[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

3,Material Girl,"Material Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day
[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)

[Verse 3]
Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

[Verse 3]
They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

11,God Control,"God Control Lyrics[Verse 1: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don’t have a chance
To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh
I think I understand why peopl﻿e get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence, spread everywhe﻿re
They say that we need love
But we need more than this

People think that I’m insane
The only gun is in my brain

Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we’ve lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don’t have a chance
Get a decent job, have a normal life
When they talk reforms﻿, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

Make him express how he feels

Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

14,I Don’t Give A,"I Don’t Give A Lyrics[Verse 1: Madonna]
Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure
[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row
[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

[Bridge: Madonna]
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a
(I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't

Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, inna all ya Prada!

And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!

22,Veni Vidi Vici,"Veni Vidi Vici Lyrics[Intro: Nas]
Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
[Verse 2: Madonna, Nas]
(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (Music saved my life)

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 3: Nas]
In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trappers, any rapper
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses keep a man in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from
[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

If I live to tell the secret I knew then

How would they hear the beating of my heart?

Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game

I want more than just romance

Cupid, please take your aim at me

Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy

Of ever leaving, I never would

Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head

Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue

Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?
[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)

I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more

This type of modern life, is it for free?

I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Llegó a la disco montando
Perrear con sus amigas, es lo que le gusta
Ella es la reina de su combo y nada la intimida
Es que es la más dura
Sólo utiliza Chanel
Qué bien lo combina con su joya Cartier
Dicen que su ex-novio la dejó por infiel
Le gustan menores como yo, se le ve
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Maluma]
Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene

[Chorus: Madonna & Maluma]
Bitch, I'm loca
Y yo loco, loco
Bésame la boca
¿Y tú qué me das? (Ay)
Bitch, me gusta
Y yo te provoco
Mucho que me asusta
Por eso no te vas

[Verse 2: Madonna & Maluma]
Quiero ser tu perra, también tu bebecita
Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita
I like to be on top, ver como te excitas
Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Bridge: Madonna &  Maluma]
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca
Ella es mi loca, loca y yo soy loco, loco
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca
Pero si me pide yo se lo co–, lo co–
[Verse 3: Madonna]
Maybe you only had a message
That you can manage this type of entertainment
I haven't let a boy who was a bit of damage
Somehow I think you like that, I see if you can last
Forget about the future and we have no past
I like the way you move and you know you're just my type
I guess you like a crazy girl but it's alright

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Maluma]
Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene, yeah yeah!

I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering

But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise

I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay

59,What It Feels Like for a Girl,"What It Feels Like for a Girl Lyrics[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?

First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

You knew all along what I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

My baby's got a secret

67,Rebel Heart,"Rebel Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say, ""Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?""
I said, ""Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be""
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, ""Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for""

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart
[Verse 2]
I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say, ""Look at you, look at you!""
Trying to be so provocative
I said, ""Oh yeah, that was me""
All the things I did just to be seen
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, ""Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be""
I said, ""Hell yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be""

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart

68,Nothing Really Matters,"Nothing Really Matters Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
[Verse 2]
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

[Bridge]
Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms
[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters

And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words

You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

73,Unapologetic Bitch,"Unapologetic Bitch Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then you let it go
See you tryin' to call me, but I blocked you on my phone
It took a minute, but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you're saying that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an

[Verse 2]
I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, get it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

74,American Pie,"American Pie Lyrics[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll?
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

[Verse 3]
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes (Both kicked off your shoes)
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
[Verse 4]
I was a lonely teenage bronking buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 5]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

[Verse 6]
Well now, in the streets the children screamed (The children screamed)
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed (The poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken (Not a word was spoken)
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing
[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

From the man that I cannot keep
My mother who haunts me, even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky
Out to the lake, into the rain
That matted my hair, and soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

[Chorus]
I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me
[Verse 2]
I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks
Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath, and thought about your death
I ran to the lake, up into the hills
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All forgotten names
I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears

And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
Black sky opened up, blinding me

[Chorus]
I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes, and up to the hill
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still

Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near

He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works
I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves
Apostles
But are not
And found them to be false
I know you are enduring patiently
And bearing out
For my namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned
The love you had
I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews
But they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

[Refrain]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

[Verse 2]
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne
And great authority

One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound
That was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder
Men worshipped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshipped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""
And the beast was given a mouth
Uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous
Words
Against
God

It was allowed to make war on the saints
And to conquer them
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it
In vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

[Refrain]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love

[Verse 3]
Then
I saw a new heaven
And a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them
And they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning
Nor crying
Nor pain
Anymore
For these things will have passed away""

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators
And all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone

And he said to me
He said to me
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near
Let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy
Behold
I am coming soon
I am the alpha
And the omega
The first
And the last
The beginning
And the end""

99,Where Life Begins,"Where Life Begins Lyrics[Intro]
Warm inside, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about
I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you in case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss
[Chorus]
So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

[Verse 2]
Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is
[Verse 3]
Colonel Sanders says it best
""Finger licking good""
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood?
Are you still hungry; aren't you glad we came?
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside

Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good

Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now
What happened?
What do I remind you of?
Your past? Your dreams?
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

[Verse 1]
You need so much, but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong, but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh, it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger, in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert
An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razor's edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn a blind eye
Tried to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or
Running away from all this madness
[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end, then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

[Verse 2]
All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You can thread a needle
With a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice
To be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
From the Tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness
[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain

114,In This Life,"In This Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty-three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?
What for?
[Verse 2]
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently?
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn?
In this case ignorance is not bliss

Have you ever watched a grown man cry? (What for?)
Some say that life isn't fair (What for?)
I say that people just don't care (What for?)
They'd rather turn the other way (What for?)
And wait for this thing to go away (What for?)
Why do we have to pretend? (What for?)
Some day I pray it will end

115,She’s Not Me,"She’s Not Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Madonna]
I shoulda seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me, and talking like me, it freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night, what's that about?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I just wanna be there when you discover
You'll wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast, and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment, 'cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

I shoulda seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books, and stealing my looks and lingerie

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast, and love you in the shower

She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have

If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find
She's not me
I know I can do it better

There's someone else to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack

She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away
They couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk
I didn't know his heart was broken
Not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of
I made a vow that I would never need another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago
[Verse 5]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Daddy oh don't you dare""
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus
Daddy, won't you treat him right

[Outro]
Fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

Baby face, don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last

Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait

As quiet as it is tonight, you'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises, they cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars, there's something you should know
The angels, they surround my heart, telling me to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do
[Verse 2]
You almost fooled yourself this time, let all of the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile and you keep your lost heart raised (Lost heart raised)
With steps that edge along the ledge is much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before, you can't hide yourself from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
I still played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize

In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn
[Verse 2]
If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A heart that will not harden

What are we gonna do after we finish this?

Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says, ""'Dré baby 'Dré baby, oh""
I said, ""Just relax, ayo chill, Mo""
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it

Uh, ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walking around showing off their heinies
Wiggling, they're jiggling, they're swinging and flinging
9-7-0, yo ho, your phone's ringing
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chilling in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinning, you drunk too much gin and
Your jaw starts grinning, and this is the beginning
Of a night of an average ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (So, whatcha do?)
I took her to my place (Yo, did she sit on your face?)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's Soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screaming, nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short, short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different flows
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turning up my stereo

[Verse 1]
I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle, tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home""

They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul

And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance

Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky
You better

Not running from the past
I tried to do what's best

Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today
Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Filled it up with Warhols, it would be so cool
Coulda gone riding stallions in the countryside
With a pack of Great Danes, racing eye to eye
We coulda toured the world in a private jet
Gotten naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We coulda climbed the mountains, seen the perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda gotten drunk and driven on the Autobahn
We coulda got ourselves arrested in St. Germain
We coulda lived life crazy 'til the day we died
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, je suis désolée
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious, and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

159,Addicted,"Addicted Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watched me burn with the fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist, put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil, watch you slither away

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh, so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy

Way up like a bird in the sky

And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know there is nothing to fear

If the great sky falls down
No rain, no more rain

There's no confirmation
And only silence remains
We only know one thing

The more you resist, babe

I'll plan

And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
And deep and pure, our hearts aligned

And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love
And when you lift, you raise the sail

And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

Could turn around and love again

173,Voices,"Voices Lyrics[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Who is the master? Who is the slave?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your savior
I'm living with a stranger I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand
[Chorus: Madonna]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
So you claim madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
First you say you love me then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry, you play the game so well
I bought your illusion, you're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand
[Chorus: Madonna]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain

You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you

When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams
I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
'Cause I don't wanna say where I'm going
Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

But I don't miss the way you used to drink
I miss our talks, the universal law
You had a way of seeing through my flaws
It's so confusing, I thought I met my match
An intellectual with talent, what a catch
You always said we'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it
You wrote me poetry, you had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Shake those insecurities

Then disappear until Sunday
Back here tryna talk your shit (Oh)

Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watching, but I just wanna give you more
Don't care about nothing
I've fallen for your love in the worst way
So move closer
'Cause I can feel your body rise
The heat from you and I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

Do you wanna take it further?
And before too long

Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep running this race?

I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap, I don't have time to waste

Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand

Don't you feel sorry, don't you feel sorry

[Verse 1]
Broken like a crooked smile
A little hunched over but I walked that mile
I've woken from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

[Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me
[Verse 2]
Tied up with leather and rope
A little bit of medicine to give me hope
I'm inky like a smoking gun
It's going to take a while to heal the damage done

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn (A lesson that I needed to learn)
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

You, you make my life much brighter
You're always on my mind
You, you make my load much lighter

But if you go I'd rather think of dying instead
I never want you to leave

202,Something to Remember,"Something to Remember Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seems I've played the game for much too long
I let people buy my love and I
Never got to sing my songs for you
I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love you pay your dues
Say that happiness can not be measured
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures
What a joke

[Chorus]
I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, ""Love yourself""
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, ""Love yourself""
[Verse 2]
I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love I've paid my dues
Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather
What a shame, who's to blame?

[Chorus]
I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, ""Love yourself""
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, ""Love yourself""Embed"

And fearless
I want to start a revolution of love

First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
I'd fallen apart, once was lost, now I've been found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

There’s too much beauty in the world going to waste
Too much talent going unnoticed
Too much creativity being crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding and what’s trending

I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind, I know all about your kind

[Chorus]
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

[Verse 2]
I like the way he moved across the floor
And when he danced with me I knew he wanted more
But in the dark things happened much too fast
I should've stopped him then, I knew it wouldn't last

[Refrain]
I know that I should take my friends' advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why
[Bridge]
I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind

You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied

I know all about your kind

[Outro]
He's a pretender
He's a pretender
He's a pretender
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

He's a pretender, yeah, he knows just what to say
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away
He's a pretender, don't know how he got that way

He's a pretender
He's a pretender
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away

I don't know why I thought that you could make me happy
These tears I cry for you are so hopeless, yeah
I don't know why I thought that we were going somewhere
But you grabbed your coat and you were out the door
And now I know you don't care

212,Supernatural,"Supernatural Lyrics[Verse 1]
Made your acquaintance late one night
You were floating around, you know you gave me quite a fright
You didn't seem like an ordinary man
More like a ray of light
You transcendentally imposed yourself upon my bed
You know you didn't say very much
I'm out of body and I feel so good in my head
You know I'm really quite touched

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake up with your fragrance and it's all over me
What cologne do you wear?
I walk around with a smile on my face, 'cause you're close to me
Well I know you're somewhere
[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Verse 2]
I stay uplifted for quite some time
(You say you've lived here for quite some time)
And I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined
You know just what I want and I don't have to ask
Are you reading my mind?
You're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare
You're not the least bit obsessed with your hair
You're not upset when I come home later than ten
For a ghost you're a very good friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance

Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with

I can't see you
I know you're out there you little rascal
Stop that

I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way

Gonna take my pants off for a different kind of romance
That super-duper naturally big thing
It's outrageously large

214,Letter to Pat Leonard,"Letter to Pat Leonard LyricsDear Pat

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you. I recieved your letter in NY but I had to leave for Mich, which is where I am right now. I have thought long and hard about what I want to do with our songs, my record, the sound, the vibe etc. I had always intended to do a portion of the record with Nellie Hooper because I like the sound of all of his records and I think he has really good instincts. Then I thought about doing the rest of the record with you not really thinking what the divide would be. This is where my head was at when I left Miami. Then I started thinking about how I didn't want a record that sounds like two different producers worked on it. I allready had that nightmare experience. Then i started leaning towards Nellie doing the whole thing because he's not a song writer and I thought he would treat all songs fairly without favortism and ego involved. I sent all my demos to Nellie to listen to and while he gave it up to a few he made some disturbing remarks about how he was going to have to change the music so much he would want a writers credit. Which of course made me sick. EGO-EGO-EGO!!!! When I was in NY I had to meet with William Orbit which has you know we're trying to do a deal with and he played me more tracks that blew my mind and I mentioned that I would like to write with him and he said he had studio time and why not tomorrow? To make a long story short we ended up doing several tracks together that I absolutely adore and more importantly I love his sound. Suddenly i felt like he knew what direction I wanted to go musically (sonically). I haven't formally asked him to produce my album but I'm going to and I wanted you to know first. I know he will be gobsmacked and humble and eager to please which is not to say that you aren't but I really feel strongly about taking a new direction and William's sound is a complete departure. After making so many records it's what I need to get my blood boiling. I hope you will not be insulted or take offense by this decision. I loved working with you again. You're a brilliant musician/songwriter and I have the utmost respect for you. On top of all that I adore you. You did say you were cool with any decision I made. Obviously if we use any of your programs you will be compensated. I may use a rough vocal or two and I haven't decided if I will use all the songs we wrote. I will keep you posted on everything. I will probably be working all of July and August and September. In any case these are my thoughts for now. I'll be in LA on Monday if you want to write or call

Take care

215,Freedom (Demo),"Freedom (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]

What you risk is what you value, nothing is in vain

[Chorus]
Freedom

Prison is a state of mind we build around ourselves
Take responsibility, you can't blame someone else

We all need a hero
Are you willing to fight for what you believe in?

Are you willing to die for what you believe in?
I walk in the footsteps of giants
Remember a man who had a dream
I stay in the shadow of those who gave their lives
So we can be free

Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you
Be the change you wanna see in the world (Freedom)
You cannot, you cannot blame what you see happening in the world to anybody else (Freedom)

216,The Look of Love,"The Look of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Should have left you standing right where you stood
Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come, and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

[Verse 2]
I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked, and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go
[Chorus]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

[Verse 3]
My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

No one can erase

Always brings me closer
To the presence of you
To always have you near

I said, ""If I was in your shoes, I could not lose""

I can't pretend
I don't want this to end

221,More,"More LyricsOnce upon a time I had plenty of nothin'
Which was fine with me
Because I had rhythm, music, love
The sun, the stars, and the moon above
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea
That was when the best things in life were free
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty
Which is fine with me
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm
But look at what I got to go with 'em
""Who could ask for anything more?"" I hear you query
Who could ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie

Got my diamonds, got my yacht
Got a guy I adore
I'm so happy with what I got
I want more!
Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!
I'm no mathematician
All I know is addition
I find counting a bore
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting
(More! More!)

I got rhythm, music too
Just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue
Now, however, I own the view
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four
And if you like four, why not a few?
Why not a slew more?
More! More!

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle
More! More!
Never say when, never stop at plenty
If it's gonna rain, let it pour
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many
Much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard
You remember Mother Hubbard
(More! More!)

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more, more
(Except all, all, all)
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all (Have it all)
You may find all else above (Find all else above)
That though things are bliss
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!Embed"

227,Revenge,"Revenge Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is no such thing as revenge
You will not give as good as you got
There is no such thing as an eye for an eye
If you think you're the giver, you're not
There is no such thing as regret
There is no point in placing the blame
Hate destroys the one who hates
And everyone suffers the same

What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go

There is only love and respect
To thine own self be true
When you point the finger
There are three fingers pointing back at you

Is not necessarily what you get

Take your judgements
And let them go
Let them go

Recognize that love lives in us all

What can you lose?
Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

[Verse 2: Madonna, Mandy Patinkin, Both]
Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her
What can you lose?
But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her
What if she had to choose?
Leave it alone
Hold it all in
Better a bone
Don't even begin
With so much to win
There's too much to lose1Embed"

Each time they take the photograph
I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide
This is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
Never admit it but it hurts

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be your superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
You'll always be my soldier I can depend on
[Post-Chorus]
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

[Verse 2]
One little lie can ruin my day
Words are like weapons, they betray
When I am afraid
One word of kindness, it can save me

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

243,Like An Angel Passing Through My Room,"Like An Angel Passing Through My Room Lyrics[Verse 1]
Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

[Verse 2]
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged good-bye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
[Outro]
I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my roomEmbed"

So when you're six feet under

Good guys always finish last
Speaking of virtue
Being nice is a thing of the past
When I want something done
I'll say it with a gun
Just 'cause you're an angel
Don't mean you're havin' fun

I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you

245,God Is Love,"God Is Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
If God is love and love is God
Then why we actin' like it's not?
Everyone's afraid to change
Different doesn't make it strange
Who decides what's right or wrong?
Religion shouldn't separate
Or tell us who we're supposed to hate
We can't deny the way we're made

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, in what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
Never stop, never stop
[Chorus]
If God is love and love is God
No magician sitting in the clouds
Never let us set our rules
Determine what you say or do
Red's the color we all bleed
Let's all agree to disagree
It's in every holy book
Love your neighbor like you should

[Post-Chorus]
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, in what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing
Never stop, never stop

In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
Don't you ever stop
[Bridge]
Moses had to lead the people
Couldn't be slaves forever in Egypt
Jesus didn't die for your sins
So you could treat other people like shit
Mohammed heard, give me your call
And have to save the people from falling
All the prophets say the same words
God is love and love should come first

[Outro]
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, in what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop

The truth is like the air you're breathing

To cancel your doubt
And fly into the sun

Hurt someone helpless, it's like
Taking away all his toys, he's just a
Cry baby boy

Always feeling blue
He can be so temperamental and
I don't know what I should do, if you
Step on a little bug
He cries all over the floor, he's just a
Cry baby bore

But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time
If I turn out like him

La, la, la-la-la-la

Always teary-eyed
He acts like a real cock-a-doodle, he
Can't even tell you why
If you just play him a sappy song, he
Acts like his dogie just died
He's just a cry baby guy
No kidding, oh dear

[Verse 4]
My guy is such a whiner, he's
Worse than Betty Sue
A cockroach seen in the diner and
The tears flow out of the blue
And if I ask him to knock it off
He goes and cries in the can, he's just a
Cry baby man

I don't want to hurt his feelings
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free

And when the samba played, the sun would set so high

257,Animal,"Animal Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can practice restraint, if that's what you want
Let me zip up my boots, we can go for a walk
If I rein you in, you can follow my lead
We can ride so fast, just remember to breathe
If you start to gear up, then I'll tighten my grip
If you try to talk back, I'll be using my whip
Might be hard to hear you with my bit in your mouth
If it starts to hurt then you'll have to scream loud

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules cause there's gonna be none
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct

If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal

[Verse 2]
If you misbehave, I can make you submit
If you start to act up, I can force you to quit
If you want me to break you, I can bring you the heel
Won't be hard to tame you when it's me that you fear

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules cause there's gonna be none
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules 'cause there's gonna be none
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think

What makes them so sure?
Do they know what's right for me?

But will they be there
To catch me when I fall
Or have they just come along for the show?
The me nobody knows
Just what it's like, nobody sees
If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while
Then they could see just what it's like

When all those autumn leaves start to fall
Drifting by my window
They come up over the wall
Why does a good thing have to do end?
Can't see it happen where and when
The cycle of change can be so cruel
I've got no one to blame, I'm just a fool, you know

Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun
[Verse 2]
Miss you most of all
When they burn those bonfires tall
Smoke and ashes fill the air and the
Harvesters are everywhere
No time to waste, let's drink the wine
Don't let the fruit rot on the vine
When the sun is big and fiery it goes, you know
That is the time I miss you the most, they say

Hold on, they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

And there's dampness creeps﻿ in our bones
Seasons change, why didn't we?
Come on, bring that summer back to me

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You do not wear it on your sleeve
You never did, I've never seen you bleed
You've got so many secrets, I don't know who you are
You keep yourself from being hurt
You can't feel much of anything, I'm sure
I never know just how you feel, I don't know if it's real

[Chorus]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change

[Verse 2]
Some days I think I'll lose my mind
You're so unhappy, sometimes you're so unkind
Then I see you smile and I know why I stay
I cannot live my life this way
There's so much more, I know that I should say
You have to feed my soul and I think you should know
[Chorus]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change

[Bridge]
Envy and doubt, I'm not your friend
Let all your secrets go, tell all your demons, no
Love is a bird, she has to fly
Go to the core of you, I want much more of you (Mmm)
I want to know your secrets, I don't know who you are

[Chorus]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could changeEmbed"

Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?

[Verse 1]
I keep your photograph by my bed to remind me
That I was part of your life
I say my prayers to the sandman
That he'll find me fast asleep
Sleep has always been kind
And in my dreams you'll always be mine
But in the morning when I wake
I remember that my heart does ache

But sometimes I was afraid
That this day would come
How could you just leave me all alone now

Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide

I saw my beloved's flower garden
In my vertigo, in my dizziness
In my drunken haze
Whirling and dancing like a spinning wheel

I saw myself as the source of existence
I was there in the beginning
And I was the spirit of love
Now I am sober
There is only the hangover
And the memory of love
And only the sorrow

I yearn for happiness
I ask for help
I want mercy
And my love says:
Look at me and hear me
Because I am here
Just for that

I am your moon and your moonlight too
I am your flower garden and your water too
I have come all this way, eager for you
Without shoes or shawl

I want you to laugh
To kill all your worries
To love you
To nourish you

Oh sweet bitterness
I will soothe you and heal you
I will bring you roses
I, too, have been covered with thornsEmbed"

And you can't even call her on the phone

I won't recall the names and places of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation here and now

Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

Quieres ver y tratar de comprender la mujer

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Well I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe that in their moment of need
That they want what you want, but they don't
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry, you're gonna say goodbye
Baby tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

This waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now, what happened, what do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams, or some part of yourself that you just can't love
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Life has taught me that love, with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here, like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this
[Verse 3: Everlast]
What you waitin' for, hun, come and get it
Don't even sweat it baby doll that can wet it
I treat it like a virgin and work it over time
If honey's lookin' fine we can go the whole night
We can do the deuce sweety pie, what's the news
I bet ya when I'm done, hun, I know I'm true blue
Cause I can get explicit, baby let me kiss it
Get it while it's hot cause when I'm gone you're gonna miss it
Sexual healin' baby that's what I'm dealin'
Mirrors on the ceilin', come check the feelin'
High pitch squealin', twitch it, jerk it
I'm a stud like Captain Kirk and it's your body that I'm workin'
Cause I can get freaky like a Friday
I know you're going my way, naked on the highway
Jump into the ride, I'll take you to the pent
The name's Everlast, hun, here's what it is

[Chorus: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
I'm waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

La pendule fait tic-tac-tic-tic
Les oiseaux du lac pic-pac-pic-pic
Glou-glou-glou font tous les dindons
Et la jolie cloche fait ding-dang-dong

Mais… boum!
Quand notre coeur fait boum
Tout avec lui dit boum
Et c’est l’amour qui s’éveille

Boom!
Thunder and lightning, boom!
Don’t you know love’s in bloom?
All of my heart goes boom boom
Tout a changé depuis hier et la rue
A des yeux qui regardent aux fenêtres
Y’a du lilas et y’a des mains tendues
Sur la mer le soleil va paraître

Boum!
L’astre du jour fait boum
Tout avec lui dit boum
Quand notre coeur fait boum-boum

Le vent dans les bois fait hou-hou
La biche aux abois fait mê-ê-ê
La vaisselle cassée fait fric-fric-frac
Et les pieds mouillés font flic-flic-flac

Mais… boum!
Now you think that sounds silly in French?
I’ll be happy to sing it for you in my native tongue!

The wind in the woods goes hoo-hoo
The silly little goat goes meh meh
Broken dishes sound like fric-fric-frac
And my little feet go flic-flic-flac

Mais… boum!
Quand notre coeur fait boum
Tout avec lui dit boum
L’oiseau dit boum, c’est l’orage
Boom!
Thunder and lightning, boom!
Don’t you know love’s in bloom?
All of my heart goes boom boom

Car mon amour est plus vif que l’éclair
Plus léger qu’un oiseau, qu’une abeille
Et s’il fait boum, il se met en colère
Il entraîne avec lui des merveilles

Boum!
Le monde entier fait boum
Tout avec lui dit boum
Quand notre coeur fait boum-boum

I said boom!
Thunder and lightning, boom!
Don’t you know love’s in bloom?
All of my heart goes boom boom

I said boom boom
It goes boom boomEmbed"

Come on, girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes a little something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And, baby, then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And, baby, then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Prophecy

Prophecy

[Verse 1]
Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near
He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him
Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works
I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves
Apostles
But are not
And found them to be false
I know you are enduring patiently
And bearing out
For my namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned
The love you had
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder
And they worshipped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous
Words
Against
God
[Verse 2]
It was allowed to make war on the saints
And to conquer them
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it
In vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone who slays with the sword, then he must be slain

[Verse 3]
Then
I saw a new heaven
And a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them
And they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning
Nor crying
Nor pain
Anymore
For these things will have passed away
To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son
But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators
And all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire
And he said to me
(Prophecy)
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near
Behold, I am coming soon.""Embed"

322,Love Won’t Wait,"Love Won’t Wait Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I first saw your face
I knew that I could not hesitate
You said, ""Baby don't go too fast
If we do, then it may not last""
Time went on and I waited for you
I didn't know what else I could do
I thought that we'd always be together
You said, ""Hold on, it just gets better""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you know
[Chorus]
Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know (Love won't wait)

[Verse 2]
So here I am with my heart on my sleeve
You said, ""Baby put your trust in me""
But I have come to the end of the line
And you have taken up all of my precious time
I need to be something special to you
Everybody's somebody's fool
Won't be a fool, no, you got me all wrong
You won't know what you had 'til it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you know

[Chorus]
Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know (Love won't wait)
Love takes time (Love takes time)
And you've been taking too long (Way too long)
And time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone (Love won't wait)
[Bridge]
There wasn't anything that I wouldn't do
You led me on, you even said, ""I love you""
How can we go on when it's tearing us apart?
Are you going to break my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you're wrong

[Chorus]
Love won't wait
Love won't wait, ooh
Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know (Love won't wait)
Love takes time (Love takes time)
And you've been taking too long (Way too long)
And time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone (Love won't wait)

[Outro]
How much longer can I wait for you?
Can I keep holding on?
I've got to be strong
Got to say good-bye (Love won't wait)
How much longer can I wait for you?
Hesitate for you, baby
I've got to be strong
Got to say good-bye
Good-byeEmbed"

I see you coming and I don’t wanna know your name

I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game

Would you like to try? Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you’ll do fine as long as you don’t lie to me
And pretend to be what you’re not

Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

It’s right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of

In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop

Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away

Give me all your love
Give me all your love, and...
Let's forget about time and dance the night away

You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need
Now it’s up to Y-O-U
Are you the one? Shall we proceed?

I'm new, I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too

I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back, you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality

Fill me up with your heat, with your noise
With your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat, make it loud
Let it hurt, run it through me
Don't hold back, you are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying

Hello, Buenos Aires
Get this, just look at me dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show
Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up
With your nights, watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing

Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality

And if ever I go too far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town, I love you
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown and silence

You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death, you are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

Rio de la Plata
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio
All I want to know
Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of
Just a little touch of
Just a little touch of star qualityEmbed"
325,Each Time you Break My Heart (Demo),"Each Time you Break My Heart (Demo) LyricsEach time you break my heart
Each time you break my heart
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you'll be true to me
Cause that's the way it's got to be
Why can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk away
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine
Each time, oh, yeah
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when (each time)

Rebel heart
Rebel heart

[Verse 1]
I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say
""Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?""
I said, ""Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be""
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, ""Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for""
[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

[Interlude]
Rebel heart
Of my rebel heart
Rebel heart

[Verse 2]
I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say
""Look at you, look at you!""
Trying to be so provocative
I said, ""Oh yeah, that was me""
All the things I did just to be seen
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, ""Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be""
I said, ""Hell yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be""
[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

You see that I am weak
You see that I am silly
And pretentious
And a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope
That there could be
A person who loves meEmbed"

Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

It goes into my body and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my mini cooper
And I'm feeling super-duper
Yo, they tell me I'm a trooper and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and Pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So, I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew

And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Performed by one of my favourite singers in the whole world: Édith Piaf
Yes, and it is my honour (and I hope I don't fuck it up) to sing it for you now, a song about love, again

Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voilà le portrait sans retouches
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Je vois la vie en rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose
[Verse 2]
Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause
C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie

Anyways, while we were rehearsing in Brooklyn
Eighteen hours a day
Gaspar challenged me
To learn how to sing a fado song
I'm always up for a challenge, so I learned
A small piece, I don't know
Do you wanna hear it?
You can sing along if you know it

Perguntei a um fadista
Qual é sua devoção

Apontou-me uma guitarra
E bateu no coração

361,Unapologetic Bitch (Live),"Unapologetic Bitch (Live) Lyrics[Intro]
(When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied)
(When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side)
We only hurt the ones we love

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then I let it go
See you trying to call me but I blocked you on my phone
It took a minute but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me but I'm better off alone
Now you're saying that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
(It might sound like I'm an)
(It might sound like I'm an)

[Verse 2]
I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, get it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch

Words, they cut like a knife

Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Verse 1]
You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words

Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore
[Verse 3]
Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your words
Words, words
A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, wordsEmbed"

I have a tale to tell

[Verse 1]
I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard that it sends your body flying across the room?
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge
Isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world
I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside
He loved me
[Verse 2]
It was a time
I suffered so much I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms
Not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this Earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain that was eating me inside
Nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and
It invades me

I believe we are messengers on Earth
I believe in angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much to become who I am today

[Verse 3]
Now you have to realize
Not only do I have a family but now I have a whole hood
And that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang
I just wanted to fit in
But one day
I was forced to do something that made me open my eyes
And realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up
And they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said, ""you know what to do really
It's time to get poppy for the hood""
But I wasn't out to kill anybodyEmbed"

372,La Isla Bonita (Live),"La Isla Bonita (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Hey hey!
[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

Are you bitches in my gang?
Stanley, are you in my gang?
(Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper)
(Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter)

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me
[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)

(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)

I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

374,No Substitute for Love,"No Substitute for Love LyricsI traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Went running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now, I find
I changed my mind
I found a new religion

[Chorus]
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
[Verse 2]
I traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone
I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt fulfilled
And now, I find
I changed my mind
I found a new religion

[Chorus]
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love

[Bridge]
I've had a change of heart
I'll make a brand new start
No famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can't buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can't try
No Ferris wheel, no heart to steal
Laughter in the dark
No one night stand, no far off land
Fire that I can't spark
[Chorus]
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love

I wrote this song, ""I Rise"", as a way of giving a voice to all marginalized people. People who don't have the opportunity to speak their mind. People who are in jail, incarcerated, bullied, beaten, abused, all people who feel that they are being oppressed. I hope that this song gives people hope and courage to be who they are, and to not be afraid to be who they are, and speak thеir mind, and to love themselvеs. Because you can't love other people unless you love yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm goin' through it, yeah I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now
I can't take that now
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive

Unless you love 'em to

You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance

But you choose to look the other way

For something I want

[Speech: Madonna]
Are y'all having a good time?
Did you take your MDNA before you got here? Fuck yeah!
I wanna thank all of my fans
Who have come here tonight from all around the world
I know there are people here from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico... All over America!
I do not take your support and love for granted
Three decades is a long time to have a job
In this day and age most people don't have jobs
Believe me, I know how lucky I am
Thank you! We are all girls gone wild, yes!
Except for you, not you
You're a man, you're a real man
If you're really sure of who you are, it doesn't matter what people call you, does it?
If you're secure with yourself, they can call you any old name they want to, right?
They can call you a bitch, or a hoe, or whatever, gay, straight, bi, black, white, christian, muslim, buddhist...
We don't care, do we? Do we care?
Not my triangle bitches!
Why don't we care? Because we know what's important, it's what's on the inside! Fuck yeah!
And we are very fortunate to live in a country where we have the freedom to express ourselves and what we have to say on the inside!
Fuck yeah? (Fuck yeah!)
If you want to be a part of bringing peace into this world, you can start by treating the person standing next to you like a human being, ok? Now can I get a fuck yeah? (Fuck yeah!)
Do I have to teach Miami how to swear?
What's going on around here?  This place used to be so much fun!
I used to live here, people used to party all night long
What's- why are you even wearing a shirt?
Just take it off, baby
Show us what- have you been on the gym all day? All month? All year? Take it off
Let everybody love your body, ok?
And speaking of loveEmbed"

I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one
You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, nothing fails

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

How could I trust anyone after years of disappointment and betrayal?
How could I not want to run away
Again and again? Escape
I will never be what society expects me to be
I've seen too much
I cannot turn back
I have been kidnapped, tortured, humiliated and abused
In the end I still have hope
I still believe in the goodness of humans
Thank god for nature
For the angels that surround me
For the spirit of my mother who is always protecting me
From now on, I’m Madame X
And Madame﻿ X loves to dance

One, two, cha-cha-cha

Another me could now begin (Woo)

All the honors and titles you've pressed me to take
For I'm contented
Let me simply go on as the woman who brings her people

Though it may get harder for you to see me

Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

411,Billboard “Woman of The Year” Speech,"Billboard “Woman of The Year” Speech LyricsFirst of all I wanna uhm, I wanna say thank you to Labyrinth, that was an amazing, amazing performance. Can I put this down? Sorry, seriously. It's better this way. Ahh, I always feel better with something hard between my legs.

I stand before you as a doormat. Oh, I mean, as a female entertainer. Thank you for acknowledging my ability to continue my career for 34 years in the face of blatant misogyny, sexism, constant bullying and relentless abuse. When I started there was no internet, so people had to say it to my face. There were very few people I had to clap back at because life was simpler then.

When I first moved to New York, I was a teenager. It was 1979 and New York was a very scary place. In the first year I was held at gunpoint, raped on a rooftop with a knife digging into my throat and I had my apartment broken into and robbed so many times I just stopped locking the door. In the years to follow, I lost almost every friend I had to AIDS or drugs or gunshot. People were dying of AIDS everywhere. It wasn’t safe to be gay, it wasn’t cool to be associated with the gay community.

As you can imagine, all these unexpected events not only helped me become the daring woman that stands before you, but it also reminded me that I'm vulnerable. And in life there is no real safety except self-belief. And an understanding that I'm not the owner of my talents. I'm not the owner of anything. Everything I have is a gift from God. And even the shitty fucked up things that happened to me, that still happen to me, are also gifts to teach me lessons and make me stronger.

I'm receiving an award for being woman of the year, so I ask myself ""what can I say about being a woman in the music business? What can I say about being a woman?"".

When I first started writing songs, I didn't think in a gender-specific way. I didn't think about feminism. I just wanted to be an artist. I was of course inspired by Debbie Harry and Chrissie Hynde and Aretha Franklin, but my real muse was David Bowie. He embodied male and female spirit and that suited me just fine. He made me think there were no rules. But I was wrong. There are no rules - if you're a boy.

If you're a girl, you have to play the game. What is that game? You're allowed to be pretty and cute and sexy. But don’t act too smart. Don’t have an opinion. Don't have an opinion that is out of line with the status quo at least. You are allowed to be objectified by men and dress like a slut, but don’t own your sluttiness. And do not, I repeat do not, share your own sexual fantasies with the world. Be what men want you to be, but more importantly, be what women feel comfortable with you being around other men. And finally, do not age. Because to age is a sin. You will be criticized. You will be vilified. And you will definitely not be played on the radio.

When I first became famous, there were nude photos of me in Playboy and Penthouse magazine. Photos that were taken from art schools where I posed for back in the day to make money.  They weren't very sexy. In fact I looked quite bored. I was. But I was expected to feel ashamed when these photos came out, but I was not. And this puzzled people.
Eventually I was left alone because I married Sean Penn, and not only would he would bust a cap in your ass, but I was off the market. So for a while I was not considered a threat. Years later, divorced and single - sorry, Sean - I made my Erotica album and my Sex book was released. I remember being the headline of every newspaper and magazine. And everything I read about myself was damning. I was called a whore and a witch. One headline compared me to Satan. I said, ""Wait a minute, isn't Prince running around with fishnets and high heels and lipstick with his butt hanging out?' Yes, he was. But he was a man. This was the first time I truly understood that women really did not have the same freedom as men.

I remember feeling paralyzed. It took me a while to pull myself together and get on with my creative life. Get on with my life. I took comfort in the poetry of Maya Angelou, and the writings of James Baldwin, and in the music of Nina Simone.

I remember wishing that I had a female peer I could look to for support. Camille Paglia, the famous feminist writer, said that I set women back by objectifying myself sexually. ""Oh"", I thought, ""so if you're a feminist, you don't have sexuality, you deny it."" So I said ""fuck it. I'm a different kind of feminist. I'm a bad feminist.""

People say that I'm so controversial. But I think the most controversial thing I have ever done is to stick around. Michael is gone. Tupac is gone. Prince is gone. Whitney is gone. Amy Winehouse is gone. David Bowie is gone. But I'm still standing. I'm one of the lucky ones and every day I count my blessings.

What I would like to say to all women here today is this: Women have been so oppressed for so long, they believe what men have to say about them. And they believe they have to back a man to get the job done. And there are some very good men worth backing, but not because they're men - because they're worthy. As women, we have to start appreciating our own worth and each other's worth. Seek out strong women to befriend, to align yourself with, to learn from, to be inspired by, to collaborate with, to support, to be enlightened by.

As I said before, it's not so much about receiving this award as it is having this opportunity to stand before you and really say thank you, as a woman, as an artist, as a human. Not only to the people who have loved and supported me along the way, you have no idea... you have no idea how much your support means.

But to the doubters and naysayers and everyone who gave me hell and said I could not, that I would not, that I must not - your resistance made me stronger, made me push harder, made me the fighter that I am today. Made me the woman that I am today. So thank you.1Embed"

To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Think you're gonna get away without the spotlight on you?

We deserve only the best
Each and every one of us
So if I told you once, I told you one hundred thousand times

[Express Yourself]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express yourself
Hey hey hey hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
I said express what she's got, oh baby, ready or not
Come on, Lisbon
Express what we've got (Oh baby, ready or not)
No, that wasn't good enough
One more time, I'll give you one more chance
Express what we've got (Oh baby, ready or not)
Not bad, I'll take it, I'll take it
Alright

We gotta get on with this, so

Because his house's falling down
And his eyes are burning as they touch the ground
The baseball cap won't hide the pain
There's no one here today
He runs through a house
And he looks for food
He feels so bad
But he knows he's good
He lays down on the kitchen floor
He ain't hungry no more
Little boy lost
In little boy land
How much does it cost
To understand
Little boy say
Why do you cry
And how much will you pay
To know why
Sometimes at night he wets his bed
As you stay playing tricks inside his head
He waits so cold
For a longer life
There's no one here tonight

In little boy land
How much does it cost
To understand

Why do you cry
And how much will you pay

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered

I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said

It's human nature (It's human nature)
(Fuck the rain!)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex

I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

Each time you break my heart
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you’ll be true to me
Cause that's the way it's got to be
Why can’t you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk away
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There’s no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
I see the look in your eyes
I know you’re hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine
Each time, oh, yeah
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There’s no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when (each time)

Obrigada
So, you know, I talk a lot about freedom in my show
And being a freedom fighter
But fight for freedom comes with a price, as we all know
It's a commitment, it's a lifestyle, do you have to ask yourself, ""Do I have the balls to really be a freedom fighter?""
Do you? (I do)
Do you?  (I do)
You do?
You're very shy, you freedom fighters
You can't be a little freedom fighter, size-matters
As I said earlier, quoting the great James Balwdin
""Artists are here to disturb the peace""
So I hope that I have disturbed your peace
And I shall continue
Because after all, we are not here to be popular
We are here to be freeEmbed"

When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me, and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

She might cook you breakfast, and love you in the shower

She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won’t be the same)

Under a different light, it’s all so clear
And she was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books, and stealing my looks and lingerie

Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

The more that you wait, the more time that you waste

All comes back to-

Nothing makes the darkness go

Make pop artists scatter when we talk chit-chatter

Or who ass really fatter, my kadunk-kadunk badder
A rap so sick, won't stop, won't quit
All on my dick, like my name was 50 Cent, G-Unit
I come with the heat, see my hits
Sound so sweet, Missy ain't pissy
Is you dizzy, is you with me
Tip me when you see me, 'cause you tryna get with me

Tougher than armor for your pappy and your mama

You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
This is a Madonna exclusive
This is the American life, fuck it

[Verse 4: Madonna]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems
What it seems
[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]

I live the American Dream

You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

Of course, you have to sing along!

[Verse 1]
I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
Until you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me, baby this I know, 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you
[Verse 2]
I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh-so many times
Those tear drops, they won't fall again
I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

[Chorus]
Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

Are you having a good time?
Me too

[Verse 1]
There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free
[Verse 2]
Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

[Verse 3]
My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away
They couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk
I didn't know his heart was broken
Not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of
I made a vow that I would never need another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage
[Interlude]
I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly
I got to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I got to save his life

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
Find somebody to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find somebody to love me
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
I've got to let it go
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father

My heart is in your hand
And yet you never stand
Close enough for me to have my way

To laugh, not to weep
Your eyes, they go right through
And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?
[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope, and if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing Is what it seems

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argеntina
The truth is I never lеft you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is trueEmbed"

Now there's no point in placing the blame

If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen

Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it’s real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

[Verse 2]
When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I’ll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Hear it on my window pane

And I say, never go away

[Spoken Interlude]

Waiting is the hardest thing	It’s strange
I tell myself that if I believe in you	I feel like I've known you before
In the dream of you	And I want to understand you
With all my heart and all my soul	More and more and more
That by sheer force of will	When I'm with you
I will raise you from the ground	I feel like a magical child
And without a sound, you'll appear	Everything strange
And surrender to me, to love	Everything wild

521,Rebel Heart (Live),"Rebel Heart (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say
""Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?""
I said, ""Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be""
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, ""Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for""

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart
[Verse 2]
I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say
""Look at you, look at you!""
Trying to be so provocative
I said, ""Oh yeah, that was me""
All the things I did just to be seen
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, ""Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be""
I said, ""Fuck yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be""

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Don't ask me where I wanna go

I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems

If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with some people just like (you)

When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart

Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no

To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you ‘til you can't come down

But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?

So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Don't go for second best, baby

You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
So please

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

And now you want your freedom
You got just what you came for

Now I'm no longer needed

Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

And left me with your mess

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone

When you call my name

I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, feels like I'm dreaming)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, feels like I'm dreaming)

Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic's shit is dope, and if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American Dream

For your anger to end

You only see what your eyes want to see

Now there's no point in placing the blame

Let all the hurt inside of you die

You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

If you could see me the way I see myself
I can't pretend to be someone else

When I try to explain how I feel

Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new

I never expected it to

Mi vida entera te la dedico
Más no te ves, te necesito

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

No llores por mí, Argentina

Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
[Verse 2]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
Whеn you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a littlе weak?

[Chorus]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?

[Outro]
For a girl
In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?

A man can tell a thousand lies

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
And how would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

588,If You Go Away,"If You Go Away LyricsIf you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an еmpty room full of empty space
Like thе empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your dog
If I thought it might keep me by your side
If you go away, if you go away
Please don't go awayEmbed"

And surrender to me, to love	Everything wild

I’m no stranger to deception
I have lied and been lied to (Uh, so have I)
I’m no paragon of virtue
But I wanna be with you
I have never been a righteous soul
And I don’t pretend I am
But I walk the line when I’m with you
Because you make me believe I can

But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me
But it’s time to speak your mind

Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine

And we’ll be traveling across sky

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I’m not good at keeping quiet
And I can’t keep this tied down
But it’s got to count for something
That we’re still hangin’ around
If you need an explanation
What is false and what is true
Then I’d rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you

But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me (Don’t know if it’s you or me)

And maybe then you'll know your love is real

The more that you wait, the more time that you waste
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own
It sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your own

Lift me up, up, up, up, up
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love's gonna lift me up
Love's gonna lift me up, me up, me up, me up...
Lift me up (Love's gonna lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up, lift me up...
Up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart
[Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
(Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on)

[Verse 2]
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
(Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on)
(I'm gonna carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on)
But I will never forget

Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on

Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up

Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I’m a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I’m in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky
You better
[Chorus]
Like hanky panky

Don't take out your handkerchiefs

Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there’s nothing wrong with me
I just like things a little rough
And you better not disagree

Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty-three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?
What for?
[Verse 2]
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently?
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

[Bridge]
People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself

Have you ever watched a grown man cry (What for)
Some say that life isn't fair (What for)
I say that people just don't care (What for)
They'd rather turn the other way (What for)
And wait for this thing to go away (What for)

But I walk the line when I’m with you
Because you make me believe I can

And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me

And I can’t keep this tied down

What is false and what is true
Then I’d rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

The truth is I never lеft you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there

And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

A long, long time ago I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll?
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

[Verse 3]
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes (Both kicked off your shoes)
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
[Verse 4]
I was a lonely teenage bronking buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 5]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

[Verse 6]
Well now, in the streets the children screamed (The children screamed)
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed (The poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing
[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

We started singing, We started singing
We started singing We started singing
We started singing We started singing

Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
You know, you know you've got to
You know, you know you've got to
You know, you know you've got to
Express yourself
So if you want it right now
Baby ready or not
It goes something like this
It goes something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)
[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
Express himself

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it

Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

[Verse 1]
I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
To say you love me
You’re thinking of me
But we're never together

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That’s why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
[Verse 2]
You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

Bye bye baby bye bye

That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye

That's why we have to say goodbye

What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That’s why it's time to say bye bye

Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowing in the wind
To love you is a sin

What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

The first time and the last time
You can forget about it, baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it, baby
Bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it, baby

You'll ever see me cryEmbed"

On any given night, catch me on the floor
Workin' up the sweat, that's what music's for
I'd rather not explain, for me, it's just usual

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that, ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
Once I get going, I am gone
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that, ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
I'll keep it going all night long

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me, it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one
The only one that the light shines on (Hey!)
[Verse 2: Madonna]
This complicated life, I try to do my best
I always tell myself it's all just a test
For me, it's an escape, 'cause dancing makes me feel beautiful

(And I can't pretend, it should never end, let the music play, are you watching that?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(She's alright, alright, alright)

I'll keep on dancing through the night

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new (C'mon)
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one, the only one)
The only one (Oh) that the light shines on (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious, and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]
Rescue me
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

[Verse 2]
With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he callеd to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayеd that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Missy and Madonna boy, ain't nothin' better
Hotter than fat dancin' in a sweater
Madonna, am I okay skinny or fatter?
When I rap on this track, all I smell is cheddar
You and I together, yo', we're tougher than leather
Make pop artists scatter when we talk chit-chatter
It really don't matter what time of day or weather
Or who really fatter, my kadunk-kadunk badder
A rap so sick, won't stop, won't quit
All on my -ish, like my name was 50 Cent, G-Unit
I come with the heat, see my hits
Sound so sweet, Missy ain't pissy
Is you dizzy, is you with me?
Tip me when you see me, 'cause you tryna get with me
Madonna bring the drama, oh mama, that's trauma
Tougher than armor for your pappy and your mama
[Verse 2: Madonna & Missy Elliott]
I tried to be a boy, I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess, I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong, that's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
(I'd like to express my extreme point of view)
(I'd like to express my extreme point of view)

So I went into a bar, looking for sympathy
A little company, I tried to find a friend

This type of modern life, is not for free
Do I have to change my name?

Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef (Chef)

Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by?
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden

Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for
[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Outro]
Somewhere in Fontainebleau
Lies my secret gardenEmbed"

Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

You're not afraid to tell me, miles away

I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear

Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

Made your acquaintance late one night
You were floating around, you know you gave me quite a fright
You didn't seem like an ordinary man
More like a ray of light
You transcendentally imposed yourself upon my bed
You know you didn't say very much
I'm out of body and I feel so good in my head
You know I'm really quite touched

I wake up with your fragrance and it's all over me
What cologne do you wear?
I walk around with a smile on my face, 'cause you're close to me
Well I know you're somewhere

Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Verse 2]
I stay uplifted for quite some time
(You say you've lived here for quite some time)
And I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined
You know just what I want and I don't have to ask
Are you reading my mind?
You're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare
You're not the least bit obsessed with your hair
You're not upset when I come home later than ten
For a ghost you're a very good friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

No fire that I can spark

If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
[Verse 2]
When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Bridge]
I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

[Breakdown]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away

Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leavе this place
So I can forget evеry single hungry face

Get wild, get moving (Oh yeah)

When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know

And my mama made me learn this song

They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

And I believed it instead of remembering

And I'm never gonna hide it again

I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

[Verse 1]
With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious, and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could bе
A person that loves me
[Chorus]
Rеscue me
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

[Verse 2]
With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]
Rescue me
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

Rescue me
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

Love is understanding
Its hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an s.o.s
Stop me from drowning baby I'll do the rest

Your love has given me hope
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

Rescue me
Your love has given me hope

Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage to love me for me

[Verse 1: Madonna]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard
I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After thе heartache, I'm gonna carry on

You nevеr would believe thе things that I have seen

I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear

If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

It seems to me that's what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
You stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible
[Verse 2]
From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to white
An Impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems to me that's what you're like
The ""Look but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly, it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)

Nothing's indestructible, nothing's indestructible

I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away
[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we'rе miles away
You're not afraid to tell mе, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Let me out of my cage 'cause I'm dying

This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye
[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye (say good-bye)
Say good-bye

[Bridge: Madonna, Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?
[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
I guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?Embed"

Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

There's no greater power

Could you be a little weak?

[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like
What it feels like
For a girl?
What it feels like
For a girl?
What it feels like
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl? (Do you know?)
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl?

You give me
You give me fever
You give me
You give me fever

[Verse 1]
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
Because they don't know how to love you my way

You give me fever, when you kiss me
(You givе me fever)
Fеver when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
(You give me fever)
Fever all through the night
[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
Because I know you're gonna treat me right
Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

[Chorus]
You give me fever
(You give me fever)
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight

Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong

Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After thе heartache, I'm gonna carry on

Built me up, and I could do no wrong

Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

And there's this God in the sky and the angels

And there's this God in the sky and the angels
How they sit, you know in front of the light

Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Where's the party?

[Verse 1]
Working Monday through Friday takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend, everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy, that's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby, time to come undone

Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)

Wherе's the party? (Where's thе party?)

Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control
[Verse 2]
Couldn't wait to get older, thought I'd have so much fun
I guess I'm one of the grown-ups now, I have to get the job done
People give me the business, I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos, got to get away from here

Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down

What a child will believe

For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinned

Why am I running away?

Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

967,​secretprojectrevolution,"​secretprojectrevolution LyricsEconomic markets are collapsing. People all over the world are suffering and people are afraid, and what happens when people are afraid? They become intolerant. They start pointing the finger at other people. They say, “You’re the reason. You’re the problem. You’re to blame. Get out!” The enemy is not out there. The еnemy is within.

All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl. - Jean-Luc Godard

I did my tour of duty this yеar, and it feels like I’ve been to hell and back. I saw many things I did not like. I saw apathy. I saw intolerance. I saw desperation and poverty. I saw discrimination and bigotry, and a kind of sinister black cloud of hypocrisy moving in on me, like a curtain of despair. Yeah, that’s right. I saw a lack of desire like a plague, putting everyone into a kind of a trance. And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness. I saw hopelessness. I saw humans searching for a way out. Another new and exciting distractio. An excuse to do nothing. An external enemy to blame.

But I also saw people desperate for a way in, looking for guidance, looking for inspiration, for hope. Looking for love. I keep telling everyone that I want to start a revolution, but no one is taking me seriously. If I had black skin and an afro, would you take me seriously? If I was an Arab waving a hand grenade, would you take me seriously? If I was wearing combat gear and I had an AK-47 strapped to my back, would you take me seriously?

Instead, I’m a woman. I’m a blonde. I have tits and an ass, and an insatiable desire to be noticed. “Come on, baby. Show us your ass. Shake it for us, baby. Do that dance you do so well for us, baby.” And some people like it when I show my ass. And some people think it’s obscene. Judgment over compassion, and fear over love. And that is obscene.

(""Show us your ass."")

Ok, but I still want to start a revolution. Somebody’s got to. There’s too much beauty in the world going to waste. Too much talent going unnoticed. Too much creativity crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding and what’s trending.

But it’s time to wake up before it’s too late. History’s repeating itself. Don’t you see a pattern here? We live in a very scary time. Or should I say, we don’t really live at all?
Democracy doesn’t seem to exist anymore. Freedom of expression sounds like a catchphrase. And if you want to be an artist in this day and age, you better have strong arms. You better be prepared to swim upstream in shark-infested waters. You better have thick skin. Because when those Fascist dictators posing as righteous men come for you with their big leather boots to shut you up, to put a gag in your mouth, to send you away to a penal colony, you better be prepared to fight for what you believe in. I used to think I had thick skin, but right now, it feels like I have no skin, like I have been skinned alive. You better be prepared to die for what you believe in.

[Martin Luther King Jr. - I Have a Dream]
“…in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation…”

[Prisoner]
“I think… I think he has no one to … to help him. I guess I’m… I’m lost. I just feel I need to… to create some… some frame in my mind, you know? To not feel so lonely.”

I don’t sleep anymore. I’ve lost my appetite. I don’t feel safe. Lots of people don’t feel safe. That’s why I want to start a revolution. But this revolution will not be televised. It will not be on the Internet. It won’t be an app available on your iPhone. You won’t be able to download it.

This will be the revolution of thinking for yourself, of having your own opinion and not giving a damn what people say. This will be a revolution of inquiring further, of not worrying about winning other people’s approval, of not wishing you were someone else, but perfectly content to be who you are, someone unique and rare and fearless.

I want to start a revolution of love.

And this revolution will overcome all fear and all suffering and all separation. And it will include all people. Black, white, Christian, Chinese, Muslim, Jew, gay, straight, bisexual, fat, thin, handicapped, rich, poor, artistic and autistic. Fuck labels. I hate labels. We’re all in this ship together, sailing like a burning sphere across the sea. Burn, baby, burn.

""My country, ‘tis of thee. Sweet land of liberty. Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrim’s pride.""

I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant!

We want to fight for the right to be free! To be who we are! Yes! Yes!

This is a very scary time, but we can make a difference! We can change this! We have the power! And we don’t have to do it with violence. We just have to do it with love. Jesus preached this. Muhammad preached this. Buddha preached this. Moses preached this. It’s in every holy book. Love thy neighbor as thyself, ok? So, you cannot use religion to treat other people badly. You cannot use God’s name to treat other people badly. We all deserve love.

I feel naked and alone. I’m sure you can relate. Sometimes I want to beat myself up. Sometimes I say to myself, “Why didn’t I wait? Why did I listen to all those voices in my head? Why didn’t I have patience? Why did I let all that doubt into my head? Into my belief system? Why?”
I know what you’re thinking. “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.” But it’s too late. I am in the kitchen, and the burner’s on full blaze.

I want to start a revolution. Are you with me?

“Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrim’s pride. From every mountain side. Let freedom ring.”

Freedom is what you do with what’s been done to you. - Jean-Paul Sartre

This film is dedicated to those who have been persecuted, are being persecuted, or may be persecuted. For the color of their skin, their religious beliefs, their artistic expression, their gender. Or their sexual preferences. Anyone whose human rights have been violated.Embed"

Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita

[Verse 1]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance (Don't keep your distance)

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
And always will be

Oh-oh, so I chose freedom
Oh, Argentina
Oh, don't cry for me

Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all

My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina

I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)

Don't cry for me

But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true

First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
(Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on)

I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget (Forget, forget, forget)
But I will never forget (Forget, forget, forget)

Fever all through the night

When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams
I'm stuck like a moth to a flamе
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Lеt me out of my cage cause I'm dying

Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

992,If You Forget Me (Poem),"If You Forget Me (Poem) LyricsIf you forget me
I want you to know one thing
You know how this is
If I look  at the crystal moon
At the red branch  of the slow autumn at my window,
if I touch near the fire, the impalpable ash
Or the wrinkled body of the log
everything carries me to you
As if everything that exists
Aromas, light, metals
We're little boats that sail
Toward those isles of yours that wait for me
Well, now
If little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you, little by little.
If suddenly you forget me
Do not look for me
For I shall already have forgotten you.
If you think it long and mad
Thе wind of banners  that passes through my life,
And you dеcide
To leave me at the shore  of the heart where I have roots
Remember, that on that day, at that hour
I shall lift my arms  and my roots will set off  to seek another land.
But  if each day, each hour
You feel that you are destined for me with implacable sweetness
if each day a flower  climbs up to your lips to seek me
Ah, my love, ah, my own
In me, all that fire is repeated
In me, nothing is extinguished or forgotten
My love feeds on your love, beloved
And as long as you live, it will be in your arms
without leaving mineEmbed"

There's still a chance for us

Don't be so shy
There's reasons why it's hard

Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita
Evita, Evita, Evita

[Verse 1]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
[Chorus]
No llores por mí, Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
Más no te ves, te necesito

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
No llores por mí, Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
Más no te ves
No llores por mí, Argentina
Jamás yo te he abandonado
Aunque en silencio, mi alma te grita
Oye por siempre (Soy Argentina)
Soy Argentina

Ohh, so I chose freedom
No llores por mí
¡No llores por mí!
