0,Billie Jean,"Billie Jean Lyrics[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)
[Outro]
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Hoo! She's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee! Aaow! Ooh!)

As he came into the window

2,They Don’t Care About Us,"They Don’t Care About Us Lyrics[Intro]
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Overlapping voices)

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
[Verse 5]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(We're deep in the fire)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about-
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about-
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

4,Thriller,"Thriller Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh
[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh
[Verse 3]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow!)
[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

5,Man in the Mirror,"Man in the Mirror Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!
[Outro]
Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)

Why?

Looking out, across the nighttime

Hear her voice, shake my window

Get me out, into the nighttime

8,Dirty Diana,"Dirty Diana Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

She said ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""
[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright""
I said ""But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key""
She said ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

But, if you're thinking about my baby

Think about the generations and say that we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they, they, they know it's a better world for them, and think, if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying

17,You Are Not Alone,"You Are Not Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, ""How did love slip away?""
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone
[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, ""How did love slip away?""
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]

Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart

And girl you know that I'll be there

Though you're far away, I am here to stay

Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

The whole system sucks, damn it
Peek in the shadow, come into the light

And I won't give up the fight

23,Jam,"Jam Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

24,Dangerous,"Dangerous Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said ""You know my name""
(You know my name!)
""And don't you pretend you never did me before""
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Ad-Libs]
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]

You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart, at your call
I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do

At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me? I'll wait for you

This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you

27,Stranger in Moscow,"Stranger in Moscow Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

There is something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who's doing me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)

Oh, she wants to give it (She wants to give it)

The truth of lust to woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby (Oh)
Just promise me whenever we say (And we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow (Never knew)
To just keep it in the closet

If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it

I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want

30,Who Is It,"Who Is It Lyrics[Verse 1]
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
[Post-Chorus]
Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

It is a friend of mine?

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin' with the devil, what?

Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, ""I don't,"" she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

Whoa, no
Alright
Oh (I’m in love, love)

[Verse 3]
I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said, ""I don't,"" she didn't have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

[Verse 1]
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but
[Pre-Chorus]
If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Verse 2]
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers
[Pre-Chorus]
If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Bridge]
You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God, then you will hell him
You would do anything for money
[Chorus]
Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you

This time around I never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're makin' me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna get me, you really wanna get me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, (They thought) they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, (They thought) they really had control of me
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
This time around I'm not gonna get bit
Though you really wanna get me (You really wanna get me)
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna fix me (You really wanna fix me)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
They get people to use me and then falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me

He really thought he really had a hold of me

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t jokin'
Indo smoke got me chokin', I'm hopin'
A fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby (This time around, yeah!)

He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

49,Childhood,"Childhood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known
[Verse 2]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

[Verse 3]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

For a man to just don't appreciate

She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Circulate the lie you confiscate

As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves?

Just because you read it in a magazine

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize

Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory

You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it

As I drove across on the highway, my jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""

[Chorus]
Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness""
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies, and the birds
And the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

56,Speechless,"Speechless Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
But I am speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I'm in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
[Chorus]
Speechless (speechless), speechless (speechless), that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real

[Verse 3]
I'd go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace

[Chorus]
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you, I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

[Outro]
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words

The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name, then push them town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place, but I won't hide away

Escape (Escape)
I gotta get away from a system
Lose in the world today

How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (Oh)
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you (You)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
To be concerned about you, I can't do what I want to

Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, making love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn

[Chorus]
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
[Verse 2]
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you’ve never known

[Pre-Chorus]
(Break of dawn, break of dawn) there’s no sun up in the sky
(Break of dawn, break of dawn) I can see it in your eyes
(Break of dawn, break of dawn) girl you got to understand

Break of dawn

I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love

Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out
It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, making love ‘til it’s dark
Let me move, let me soothe, ‘til the break of dawn and you know it’s true, oh

I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart

You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night

Hello midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more

Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful

If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone

Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were

To show that he cares

But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

[Chorus]
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

[Bridge]
It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared
[Verse 3]
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair12Embed"

They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You've got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me

You've got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me
[Chorus]
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Stop trippin'

[Verse 2]
We have got more problems
Than we will ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet

We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walking into darkness
Tell me
What are we doing
To try to stop this?

Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?

But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only have yourself to blame

You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

Then the world has got no shame

Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe  that I can´t tell her no

Her actions confess and put me through the test

But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

She will say I was the man that got away

And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
Give yourself a chance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Because you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem
[Chorus]
So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it, brother

[Verse 2]
And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone?

So give yourself a chance

Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try
[Chorus]
So keep the faith (Oh)
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah

Lift up your head and show the world ya got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be better, but you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother

[Bridge]
I know that keepin' the faith

79,You Are My Life,"You Are My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once, all alone
I was lost, in a world of strangers
No, one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You, suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now it's all clear
You, took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are my life

Now, I wake up, every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
‘Cause you love me
You, help me understand
That love is the answer, to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

80,Threatened,"Threatened Lyrics[Intro: Rod Serling]
Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster

[Verse 1]
You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream, it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me
[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Verse 2]
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink I’'l disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me
(No, no)

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Rod Serling Verse]
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear
[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened
(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(So you should feel thre-e-e-eatened by me)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened (It's you, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (C'mon, baby, yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (You should be, hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened (Every time, she speaks to me) (Hoo-hoo!)
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You can look at them climbin' out the bushes
You can find them when the letter's 'bout to fall
He be waitin' with his camera right on focus

Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air there's a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster

Shiver a second, now, now, now, what is it?
Funerals, cemeteries, don't worry, it's time to visit
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kiddin'?
It's home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
All hail, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, there's nothin iller, it's killer
Their vision, they miss 'em, won't impact, this is that
It's the bomb, ring the alarm, MJ number one
It goes on and on, it goes on and on
We get to creeping and crawling in the early morn'
Dream on dreamer, there's nowhere to run
You can try but you're done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come

There's a ghost out in the hall

Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?

So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you

Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

[Verse 1]
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

[Verse 2]
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye (Still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

Starin', glarin', tearin' through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scarin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sittin' in my room
She walked up to my face, and said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon (Boo!)
[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

[Verse 2]
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other, hee, hee!
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's trial thought in beguile
This is scarin' me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scarin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through (Boo!)

[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)

89,For All Time,"For All Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

[Chorus]
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
[Verse 2]
Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

[Bridge]
You tried everything, you never thought of before
When you live, in your love
And you give, in your love
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
I can live, I can breathe
I can die in my sleep
Because you're always there in my dreams

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met

101,We’ve Had Enough,"We’ve Had Enough Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime

[Interlude]
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he did not run
And that my daddy had no gun
[Verse 2]
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand

He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain

[Pre-Chorus]
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that cannot be done
If we raise our voice as one
[Chorus]
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you, baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough

(Deep in my soul baby)
Deep in your soul and let God decide
(Deep in my soul)
It's up to me and I am still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
(Just let God decide)
It's going on baby
(Just let God decide)
Deep in my soul baby

We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough

You're my lover
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough (Aaow!)

And now a behind-the-scenes treat from the original voice-over session for ""Thriller"", with Michael and Vincent Price. You'll also hear the never-before-released second verse of Vincent's rap, written by Rod

[Bruce Swedien]
Okay, tape's rolling. Any--anytime you want

[Intro, take 1: Michael Jackson & Vincent Price]
Hi, this is Michael Jackson
This is Vincent Price
Michael Jackson is...
The Thriller!

[Segue: Michael Jackson, Vincent Price, Bruce Swedien]
*Vincent laughs*
Do we both say it?
Say it together?
""Inviting you to.""
I say ""inviting you to""? All right. Yeah
Okay
Any time. Tape's rolling
[Intro, take 2: Michael Jackson, Vincent Price, Michael Jackson & Vincent Price]
Hi, this is Michael Jackson
And this is Vincent Price, inviting you to...
The Thriller!

[Verse 1: Vincent Price]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

[Verse 2: Vincent Price]
The demons squeal in sheer delight
It's you they spy, so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip

[Verse 3: Vincent Price]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller
[Outro: Vincent Price]
Can you dig it?
Hmmm-Hahahahaha...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahahahahahahah...

[Post-outro: Vincent Price & Bruce Swedien]
Hmmph, that's great fun!
Great, thank you. Cut
Okay. All right!2Embed"

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have

When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause, ooh

110,Will You Be There (Theme from ”Free Willy”),"Will You Be There (Theme from ”Free Willy”) LyricsHold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, you are my friend
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother, will you be there?

Yeah, hold on, yeah
Hold on, oh, yeah

When weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?
But they told me, a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human

Yeah, oh, hold on
Yeah, oh, yeah
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me?

(Kiss me and free me) oh, sometimes
(I will feel blessed) Yeah

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence

Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part for you're always in my heart1Embed"

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
[Verse 2]
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

Give me one and don’t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put my fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Well, obviously, I do
That's why I want to be

To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-noh

I start tryin' to make you think I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't past the way I do
Because I want to be

To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go

To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be

Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care, if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?

Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you care, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray

Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I’d like to have my child

Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That’s all I've known

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

Do think twice

His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

And touches off a spark that comes shining through

Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow

My friend, my someone in the dark was you

Promise me we will always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Oh I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

[Verse 3]
Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me3Embed"

A world of sweet harmony

125,All in Your Name,"All in Your Name Lyrics[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you, is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out, how high we can fly

There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim
[Pre-Chorus]
So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done?
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Only God knows
That it’s all in the game
It’s all in Your Name
Carry me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Look to Heaven
An Angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim
[Pre-Chorus]
So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war?
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no?

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Only God knows
That it's all in the game (Oh)
It's all in Your Name (Oh yeah)
Follow me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

Say the word and I'll be there
To love you, and understand you

I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine""
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
And I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain

Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really start takin' pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive

You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Well then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues

You pay the price for fame

Blottie contre toi, je te dirai tout bas, tu me rends folle

This is not your ordinary record
Record, Re-re-record, re-re-re-cor-cor-cord (Hit it!)

[Verse 1]
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killin' me
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Livin' encased like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find
[Chorus]
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

[Verse 2]
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warnin'
But we live to see the dawn

[Bridge]
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

[Verse 3]
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespectin' each other
Whatever happened to protectin' each other?
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is buildin' and I've had enough
[Chorus]
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

[Verse 4]
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

[Chorus]
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout

And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around

It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side

Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow

And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me

I met her on the walkway
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said, ""You wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'""
We end up goin' back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say

161,Scared of the Moon (Demo),"Scared of the Moon (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alone she lies waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

[Chorus]
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

[Verse 2]
The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

[Chorus]
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do
So I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I'd got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange, feeling like a mist
I walked down toward the end of a road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry my friend
I'll take care, take my hand
I'll take you there""
[Chorus]
Ooh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A'Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and a'smilin' an' Nothin' to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness""
She turned around, looked down
In my eyes and started cryin'
And grabbed my hand
You've got a friend
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

She started likin' me
Kissin' me, and huggin' me
She didn't really really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
So then I went in my pocket
Took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought
You could be in another world

That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wantin' me)

Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue

Alive with music, haunting my soul

Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now

Until he falls asleep

She dances at the crack of dawn

Who works her overtime

Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, she dare'd not quit
As she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust

In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul

All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice

There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
[Verse 2]
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a liitle prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

This is the season of love

Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me

Who will dance on the floor in the round?""

Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)

Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn, though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember, sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above (To the one up above)

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

Oh, it's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you got through life, remember this rule

198,Do You Know Where Your Children Are (Original Version),"Do You Know Where Your Children Are (Original Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says ""What's going on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone!""

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
[Verse 2]
She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy 'er things, while sexually abusin' 'er
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothin' to eat

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Bridge]
Save me (from this living hell)
Save me (cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me (cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me (cause I'm out for blood)
Save me (cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (it's time I replied)
Save me (uh-uh)
Save me (hee-hee)
[Verse 3]
Now she's on the move, she's off ta Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
""I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair""
He is takin' her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's sellin' her body, hah, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street

199,Seeing Voices,"Seeing Voices LyricsI sing of what you see and might think about
Because of what you see
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the eye
Not the ear traces what's on the mind

So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone
So..

When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
Think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you are seeing voices

Think of them as being
As though they were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

So think of hands as asking or telling
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing voices

Voices, voices2Embed"

Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes

So what does it mean, damnit
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit
[Janet Jackson]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Makes me wanna scream

Tired of your tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (The story your way)
It's causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damnit

Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such confusion
Make me wanna scream
Now, baby
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
Schemin', baby
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
[Interlude: Janet]
Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?

But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be

214,Is It Scary/Threatened (Immortal Version),"Is It Scary/Threatened (Immortal Version) Lyrics[Is It Scary]

(Piano intro)

[Spoken Intro: Haunted Voice]
I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere
(Aaaahhh!)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

(*Whispering and breathing*)
{Sorcery...Illusions...}

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
[Interlude: Michael Jackson]
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I always feel like somebody's watching me

[Interlude: Rod Serling]
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never Land, that's the place
A monster, that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing you could fear

[Threatened]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
All hail, the king has risen
All hail, hail, the king, hail, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, king, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, the king has risen

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
[Chorus: Michael Jackson, 50 Cent]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(Ooh hoo, come on, baby)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (Yeah)
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

Making a toast to the king, MJ for life
I mess with good women
But you know that they bad, let's ride

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We all are a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
[Verse 2]
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

[Chorus]

When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let's realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walking the line
She never thought that I would have the time
She never think that I was going alone
She never thought and then she ganged up the phone
She's so

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

She never thought that I was walking the line
She never think that I would have the time
She never thought that I were going alone
She never think and then she ganged up the phone
She's so

Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Too much to be coincidental
Why you want to lead me on
I am not the one you want
So girl do not keep me hanging
You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye do not mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You would not! You would not let me let go
[Verse 2]
Ooh yeah
When we started dating making
Moves on the single scene
Never seen you so jealous
Telling all the other girls that you are still with me
You may think it is funny honey
I am not laughing
You know what I think about it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye do not mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You would not! You would not let me let go

You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go1Embed"

Mini Review of Griots Lament by Akello Stone

""These days we are bombarded with lots of visual media, stories and messages in the forms of videos. Most of it is completely unimaginative but Griot's Lament is much different It truly is a short-form ""theatrical experience on the small screen"" that evokes thoughts with the kind of intellectual depth, auditory stimulation and cadence, and visual creativity that many of us so desire. It truly captures the wonder, the suspense, the social commentary that can draw you in and leave you sitting - wanting more."" Bravo!

Trayvon Martin Revisited Via Michael Jackson’s Lyrics in “Griot’s Lament”
JULY 16, 2014 • ENTERTAINMENT, FEATURED • VIEWS: 221

There’s a new trend in entertainment, repurposing the lyrics of artists like Tupac (Holler If Ya’ Hear Me on Broadway) and now, a new web series, Griot’s Lament does the same with the King of Pop’s lyrics.  It is excellently done and one of the most innovative web series that I’ve seen in a long time and it comes from director, Aleks Munoz.

Here is what the Director had to say about his latest effort, “My next film “GRIOT”S LAMENT” applies Michael Jackson’s lyrics to the artists’ ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices .”
An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice” sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM. I use “recontexualization” of these lyrics to revisit the killings of Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and the countless number of innocent youths that have fallen prey to violence in Southwest Chicago.


“They don’t care about us” was shouted as a veiled response to the Rodney King beating , but could it have also been a foretelling or foreshadowing of the tragic humanitarian failures incurred during Hurricane Katrina? One violent scene in the film is staged to replicate the horrific Rodney King beating. The film asks the question, as Michael did repeatedly via his music: How culpable are WE… when society cannot fully function in the realm of justice?


The character “Griot” is the conduit for Michael’s often overlooked and under recognized political orientation, a perspective that is often over shadowed by the glow and power of his popular music and larger than life persona.  I began writing Griot’s Lament the night that Michael left us. In my heart , it is my sincere hope that Griot’s Lament is a fitting tribute to the King of Pop, whose music is the soundtrack to much of my life.”

The film uses formerly incarcerated youth, as both talent and crew  from Munoz’s FYI FILMS by Youth Inside, which empowers incarcerated youth via story telling and digital film making.

252,Money (Fire Island Radio Edit),"Money (Fire Island Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Die for it
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the Devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do it for the money
They don't care, they use it for the money
So you go to church, read the Holy Word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the 'Just few'
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but
If you show me the cash then I will take it
If you tell me to cry then I will fake it
If you give me your hand then I will shake it
You do anything for money
[Chorus]
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

[Verse 2]
Insurance, where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul, 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers 'cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance then you will dare it
You would do anything for money
[Chorus]
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

I don't think so
If you show me the man then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God then you will hell him

Heard he grew up in Queens
Got a bullet to the brain
Dug a step into fame

Then his life became serious

Show you the things that make a man a king

Then they say that you’re fine
But they won’t help you find, find the road again
But they won’t help you fight
So they torture your mind
They leave you delirious

Avoiding ships of fools

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest

Shall follow the feel of constant care)

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared then unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smileEmbed"

Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be

How does it feel
(How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
In the rain, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be
How does it feel
(How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

How does it feel
(How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Like a stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)
Like a stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby1Embed"

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(Back in your heart)
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Now, now, now

The Love You Save
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasin' boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart, you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back in grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop, the love you save maybe your own
Darlin' take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
(You better stop)
(The love you save maybe your own)
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me
You're heading for a danger zone

I'll Be There
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there
With a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on, ooh
(Holding on)

If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better being good to you
'Cause if he doesn't
I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know, baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there
I'll be there

Racism, bigotry, ego centrism, prejudice, hatred and violence are breaking the heart of our Planet and strangling it’s soul... And yet...We are coming alive, as never before! Nelson Mandela: a black man, a former symbol of subjugation and slavery dines South Africa... Democracy and freedom flourish as never before and a new consciousness proclaims the dawn of the Age of Enlightenment, where survival of the fittest is replaced by survival of the wisest...

Let us dream of the great and sudden splendor of a new tomorrow... Let us dream of the full flowering of a new collective consciousness... Let us dream of a tomorrow where we can hold our heads high and stretch our arms toward perfection... Let us dream of a tomorrow where we no longer fragment and fracture our global village with narrow domestic walls, where tribalism no longer services under the pretense of nationalism and patriotic favor and where we can truly live from the soul and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation...

Let us dream of a tomorrow where our children are nurtured and our elders revered and journeyed and venerated... Let us dream of peace and harmony and laughter... Let us dream of joy and ecstasy... Let us dream of dancing the cosmic dance. And, as we dream, let us remember those who dared to dream before us, sacrificed their yesterday, so we could have our tomorrow!Embed"

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years

And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Walk by the sea

Yeah yeah all rightEmbed"

Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning

There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, ""Welcome to your doom""
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

297,Childhood (Immortal Version),"Childhood (Immortal Version) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
Many of our world's problems today
Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that

[Verse 1]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me
[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

[Spoken Interlude]
When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts

[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood?Embed"

Who's bad?

[Verse 1]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones and hide your hands

And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

You know I'm bad, I'm bad

If I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For everytime I didn't understand
I'd be the world's poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you

[Chorus]
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
[Verse 2]
I would get embarrased
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

[Chorus]
Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touchEmbed"

Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion

I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

She just up and ran away

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs

And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late
And she's... out of my life

Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
(Verse 2: Michael Jackson)
She wrote that she's tired of step-daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her
Just think that she’s all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive she ain’t got nothing to eat

(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?

(Verse 3: Jay-Z)
Maintaining this is the same old thang
Little stress, little fault, too much change
I see you kept it moving, you see I kept improving
See now we have an agreement, remember how I used to walk up and down the street man
Put it down to the streets watching saying hood it down
Just to earn nothing what good is it now

(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Save me from this living hell
Save me cause that I'm gonna do
Save me I'm tired and I'm fed
Save me cause this because of you
Save me cause I’m on a debt
Save me cause I don't want no more
Save me cause terror arrived
Save me

(Verse 4: Michael Jackson)
Now she’s on the move, she’s off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money is good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
I’ll show you what the money is, girl just let down your hair
He’s taking her on the streets of sunset boulevard
She’s selling her body ha girl that will take ya far
The police comes around the corner somebody up there told
He’s arresting this little girl she’s only 12 years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are X 4

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation
All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it, HOO

Here comes the man, hot damn
The big boy stands with an upper hand
Making funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bumrushed the door, three and four's in a bundle
Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael

Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought i heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens i will bear
But first i need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and i'll come runnin'
And girl you know that i'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone...Embed"
326,Scared of the Moon,"Scared of the Moon LyricsAlone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moonEmbed"

She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and got out
And looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""
Oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing
And smiling and nothing to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and they started crying
And grabbed my hand, you've got a friend""
Oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, take me, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Oh, yeah, doggone, oh)

[Bridge]
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave? Oh
[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name (Doggone, take me, no name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, no, no, no)

And everyday i thank the lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting

Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still i need a path because
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me
Oooh...

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
Ooooh... baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Everytime your lips meet mine, my baby

Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now
Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

359,She’s Out of My Life (Original Demo),"She’s Out of My Life (Original Demo) Lyrics[Intro]
Do it one more time. I sung the wrong lyrics

[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
And the way that it stands
It's out of my hands
[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned, love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my lifeEmbed"

And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know

Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)

As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike

And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
When my baby broke my heart and left me yearning, woo
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me, hoo

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
Sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon
[Chorus]
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Evil Heartbreak Hotel

[Verse 2]
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I'm undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought
In beguile to hurt me
Then the man next door had told
She's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me, woo

[Pre-Chorus]
We came to this place
Where the vicious dwel'
Found that wicked women
Run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through
[Chorus]
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
Evil Heartbreak Hotel
Someone's stabbin' my heart

She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth""
Hey-ay
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, hoo
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son, hoo
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
Take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told, ""My baby, we'd danced 'til three""
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin'
His eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
Do a dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no heart)
But she came and stood right by me
With the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room, hey-ay
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, hoo
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No no no, a-no no, a-hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (Daggone it)
She says I am the one (Hee, hee)
But the kid is not my son

Hee, woo

But the kid is not my son (No, no, no, oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, you didn't dance with me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
(No no no, no no)
She says I am the one (Go with your kid, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Go with your kid, yeah)

Think about, um, the generations
And they say we wanna make it a better place for our children
And our children's children
So that they they they know it's a better world for them
And think they can make it a better place

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world
[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
[Pre-Chorus]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for meEmbed"

That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it and then one day you get it
It's so good too but it's just like my girl
When she's around me I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones 'cause ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

Ooh, Black cruel signing up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Signs on the man, slime's on the sea
Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be

Her schemes and plans. Go dance on
On the floor
In the round. So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(do think twice)

We'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
His eyes were like mine (oh, no!)

And a washed-out dream

The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, ""Why? Why?""
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, ""Why? Why?""

I like lovin' this way

[Refrain]
Ha-wah-oh-wah

[Verse 3]
Reaching out
Into the night-time
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
Everybody sing
[Chorus]
If they say, ""Why? Why?""
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
Everybody, ""Why? Why?""
Tell 'em that is human nature

I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean

Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don’t go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee)
And mother always told me, ""A-be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth,"" hey, hey
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son
(Hee hee hee, no no, hee hee hee, ooh)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice, woo)
She told, ""My baby, we'd danced 'til three""
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee hee hee)

[Pre-Chorus]
A-people always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room, hey hey

She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need.""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: ""There's no turning back.""
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star.""

But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said: ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright.""
Diana walked up to me
She said: ""I'm all yours tonight.""
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright.""
I said: ""But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key.""
She said: ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me.""

There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

She came at mе in sections with the eyеs of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see you've got a friend in me

Ben you're always running here and there

If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know you've got a place to go

And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

Can’t Let Her Get Away

[Verse]
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let

Dangerous

[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust

The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)

Who Is It

[Verse]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold
[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)

Remember the Time

[Verse]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Give In to Me

[Verse]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

Heal the World

[Chorus]
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Post-Chorus]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

412,Thriller (Single Version),"Thriller (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Woo-hoo), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh
[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Woo-hoo), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Woo-hoo), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, OW
[Outro: Michael Jackson & Vincent Price]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Oh darlin, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh baby, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Oh darlin', thriller night, baby, ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thrillerEmbed"

I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(she was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone

She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(she was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never would have thought
She was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

An angel sent from Heaven just for me

Enough is enough of this garbage
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

There's something you should know
You've got a place to go

I used to say ""I"" and ""me""
Now it's ""us"", now it's ""we""

I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest
(Law without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared then unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smileEmbed"

For every time a movie made you cry

I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

459,Man in the Mirror (Dutch Translation),"Man in the Mirror (Dutch Translation) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ik ga een verandering maken
Voor één keer in mijn leven
Het gaat heel goed voelen
Ga een verandering maken
Ga het goed maken
Toen ik de kraag van mijn favoriete jas omdraaide
Deze wind blaast door mijn hoofd
Ik zie de kinderen, met niet genoeg te eten
Wie ben ik om blind te zijn, niet zien of ze iets nodig hebben
Een zomer minachting, een kapotte fles
En de ziel van een mens
Ze volgen elkaar op de wind, je weet wel
Omdat ze nergens heen kunnen
Daarom wil ik dat je het weet
[Chorus]
Ik begin met de man in de spiegel
Ik vraag om zijn wegen te veranderen
En geen bericht had duidelijker kunnen zijn
Als je de wereld een betere plek wilt maken
Kijk eens naar jezelf en maak een verandering

[Verse 2]
Ik ben een slachtoffer geweest van een egoïstische vorm van liefde
Het is tijd om te realiseren
Er zijn mensen zonder huis
Geen nikkel om te lenen
Kan het echt waar zijn dat ik doe alsof ze niet alleen zijn
Een wilg diep getekend met littekens, iemand zijn gebroken hart
En een uitgewassen droom
Ze volgen de patroon van de wind, je ziet het
Omdat ze geen plek hebben om te zijn
Dat is waarom ik met mij start

[Extended Chorus]
Ik start met de man in de spiegel
Ik vraag om zijn wegen te veranderen
En geen bericht had duidelijker kunnen zijn
Als je de wereld een betere plek wilt maken
Kijk eens naar jezelf en maak een verandering
Ik start met de man in de spiegel
Ik vraag om zijn wegen te veranderen
En geen bericht had duidelijker kunnen zijn
Als je de wereld een betere plek wilt maken
Kijk een naar jezelf en maak die verandering

Ik start met de man in de spiegel
(Man in de spiegel, oh yeah)
Ik vraag om zijn wegen te veranderen
(Verander zijn wegen)
(Kom op, verander)
En geen bericht had duidelijker kunnen zijn

[Bridge]
Als je de wereld een betere plek wilt maken
Kijk eens naar jezelf en maak een verschil
Je moet het goed doen, terwijl je de tijd hebt
Omdat je je hart sluit (Je kunt niet)
Dan sluit je je hoofd (Sluit je, je hoofd!)

[Chorus]
(Die man, die man) Ik start met de man in de spiegel
(Die man)
(Ooh!)
(Die man, die man) Ik vraag om zijn wegen te veranderen
(Die man, die man)
(Verander zijn wegen, ooh!)
En geen bericht had duidelijker kunnen zijn

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

In the magical wonders they do

Move of the head and I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear from euphoric, devotions
Everything's happening, nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real
Seeing black panthers, they suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe, be it

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said ""You know my name""
(You know my name!)
""And don't you pretend you never did me before""
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!

My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous
[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time

492,Is It Scary (Radio Edit),"Is It Scary (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's haunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life

Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?

You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?

[Verse 2]
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

So let the performance start

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?

So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?

You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

[Bridge]
Masquerade the heart
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you
[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
So tell me am I scary for you baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is scary for you baby?
Am I scary for you?

You're not my girl, not my wife
Got a couple tips from Mike
I'm moon-walkin' out tonight
I close my eyes, you ought of sight

And she wanna call me conceited?
Cause I'm a smooth criminal, I told her to beat it
When a little love was all I needed
You talkin'? I call it how I see it

And now I mean it, I'm out for good
Like a lot of you when I'm movin' out the hood
But if I told you to take me back, you would
Too late, like me, Pete[?], Pac, you should
Had you in the cars for the metro
With a couple superstars from the get-tuh
Now you feelin' so sorry you let go
Of the T-E-M-P-A-Mental

Pass it through, V-I-P, it's the righteous G[?]

You going, ""Spread some love,"" like the gold rush
It was the things you did that you used to mean so much
Whatever you touch, the way you used to blush
Not me you brush[?], I don't believe in such
Nonsense, lovers don't promote violence
Non-cents, just like your dollars -- no sense
No good, I can feel it through my sixth sense
What's this? You wanna suck my existence

But still, I believe in you and me
Quite frankly, that's how it's supposed to be
The kind of love like you endin' your poverty
So I keep me scoped like a Kennedy
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do!
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(Who is it?)
Is it a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]
Hee hee, hee hee

[Chorus]
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
To me I'm bothered
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran awayEmbed"

Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
I'ma get it
I'm with you
Keep it in the closet

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson + Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Verse 4: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Now I’ve been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights you know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin’ for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin' make a boy go stone wild

But I just can’t lose my stride

And I can hear my baby callin’ my name
It's as if, as though I’m standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y’all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Y'all hope my feet don't fail me now

All is goin' my way

And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)

There was a time I used to say ""Girl, I need you""
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ain’t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way

I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside

526,Jam (Roger’s Jeep Mix),"Jam (Roger’s Jeep Mix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

531,Dangerous (Roger’s Dangerous Club Mix),"Dangerous (Roger’s Dangerous Club Mix) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said ""You know my name""
(You know my name!)
""And don't you pretend you never did me before""
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Ad-Libs]
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous
[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind

What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be

I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (Hoo)
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

She got your number, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got yo' baby, ah
It happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah
Erase the past (Ah)

To escape the world, I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Oh, babe

[Verse 2]
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!
Dah

It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me

And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is this scary for you, baby?

Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Am I scary for you, baby?

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it, hey
I don't understand it, OW

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya

Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be my friends
But they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'

If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer n**** I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open

This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rots, got Pits by the door
I reeled a set of people to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my n**** Mike like that (Michael: This time around, yeah!)

It’s a shame
Now so many believe these stories about me

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, ""I love you so, I'll never let you go""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Verse 1: Michael and Janet]
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean, damnit?
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit
Hee, hoo hoo
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light

Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Janet, Both]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice
All the injustice

[Verse 3: Treach]
Now who’s deceivin’ ya to believe in a
Monotonous fever mainstream mumble the media made up
Keeping a shadow on people, the slaves of the day
Deceived and believed that we’re equal to rights
Peep and getting even
And even when breathing, we can’t inhale freedom
Save the playa haters for later, it’s demons I’m weaving
We’re needing a scheme, it’s making me feel like screaming
[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Janet, Both]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more
[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more
[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do!

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain't joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by thе door
A real set of peoplеs to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that

596,Stranger in Moscow (Album Edit),"Stranger in Moscow (Album Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Lord have mercy

We're talking danger

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

You must have thought that I was blind
I didn't gave to look that hard to find

Why don't you take your bags and hit

Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy

And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you

Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away

607,Is It Scary (Deep Dish Dark And Scary Remix),"Is It Scary (Deep Dish Dark And Scary Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air?
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose taunting me
Because you're warning me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you?
Or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you wanna see eccentricalities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?

[Verse 2]
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin that lay open
Where a restless soul has spoken

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you've come to see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!

[Bridge]
Masquerade the heart
Is it the height of hurting souls
I'm just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

[Outro]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!

I need not conquere worlds, or fame
Not set, the pace for style

If I can follow through
On, what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleven hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God

For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
While growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...

But they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'

If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open

This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rots, got Pits by the door

Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my Mike like that (Michael: This time around, yeah!)

(Michael:)
This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of mе
He really thought, they thought thеy really had control of me
[Verse 2]
This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really want to get me
But this time around I'm taking no
Though you really want to fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me and falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 3]
(The Notorious B.I.G:)
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be my friends
But they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'

If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer n**** I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open

This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rots, got Pits by the door
I reeled a set of people to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my n**** Mike like that (Michael: This time around, yeah!)
Baby

[Chorus]
(Michael:)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Ad-Libs]
Get me, infect me
You really try to get me
Use me, accuse me
Nobody can abuse me
(Control this!) An' change me
Nobody's gonna break me
Kill me, deal with me
I hate the way you control this, here ya!
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they really... This time around, yeah!
He really thought he really had a hold of me

And use me, accuse me
Nobody can abuse me
Fix me, mix me
Nobody's gonna ditch me

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold
[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door

She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Take my name and just let me

No, no, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye

Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so?

That I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That's pressing me right through the core

It says turn around, you fool
You know you'll love her more and more
Tell me why is it so? (Get it Mike)
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, girl

(Ooh, alright)

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
Why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why? I like livin' this way
[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
Why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature

The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

Shifting shadows, the songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy

With a tender touch you would know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

One warm kiss in the cold night air
Once good love, [?] seen it

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?

666,For All Time (Original Demo from 1990),"For All Time (Original Demo from 1990) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
[Outro]
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
(That's for all time)
(That's for all time)
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all timeEmbed"

Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open

Stay away from strangers so I won't slack

674,Michael Jackson - Black or White Unmastered  (Late 1990),"Michael Jackson - Black or White Unmastered  (Late 1990) LyricsI took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)

690,Carousel (Full Version),"Carousel (Full Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I’m from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
[Verse 2]
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Bridge]
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me
[Instrumental]
(One time)

[Chorus]
Don’t you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Outro]
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who left my heart in pieces
(Lost my heart) Lost my heart
(On the carousel) Lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost (Lost my heart)
I lost my girl (On the carousel)
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost (To a circus girl)
I lost
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)

Enough
So much
I’ll disappear
I cannot lie
All i got to do is wondering why when all I can do is sigh

It’s just too much for me
It's just too much for me
It's just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it enough, enough
Enough is enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
{verse 2}
You are a ghost from hell
And my worst nightmare
Your stories everywhere
This ain’t no truth or dare
All I got to do is wondering why for you there’s no need to cry

Pre-chorus:
Please tell me why won't you just let me be

It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me

Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, enough
Enough is enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
Oh no, oh no
But I just can’t take it, just can’t take it

Spoken bridge:
You stole my soul and ruined my reputation
You changed the mind of a whole new generation
You came to me when you were no-body
So I gave you my hand but all you took was my money. You wanted more, you wanted fame
When it didn’t work out, you were calling my name
It’s a shame
Now so many believe these stories about me
But the truth about you, the world never sees

It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, enough
