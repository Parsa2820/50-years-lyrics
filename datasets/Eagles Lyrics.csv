0,Hotel California,"Hotel California Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 3]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 4]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 5]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave""

1,Take It Easy,"Take It Easy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

[Chorus 1]
Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
[Chorus 2]
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

[Chorus 3]
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

2,Desperado,"Desperado Lyrics[Verse 1]
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
You've been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

[Verse 2]
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
[Verse 3]
Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

[Verse 4]
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away…

[Verse 5]
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late25Embed"
3,One of These Nights,"One of These Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

[Chorus]
Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights
[Verse 2]
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

[Chorus]
Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

[Guitar Solo]

One of these nights
Mmm, in between the dark and the light
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you, baby, one of these nights

Hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo, hoo-hoo
One of these nights
I can feel you

One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you, now
One of these nights
And it gets so dark
So dark and cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you
Comin' right behind you, now
One of these nights
Hoo, hoohoooo
One of these nights
And I wanna say, ahhh

One of these, one of these
One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you

4,Life in the Fast Lane,"Life in the Fast Lane Lyrics[Verse 1]
He was a hard-headed man, he was brutally handsome
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, ""Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red""

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh

[Post-Chorus]
Are you with me so far?
[Verse 2]
Eager for action, hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, ""Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring""
""We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing""
He said, ""Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash""
""The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash""
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off and it was
[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

5,Lyin’ Eyes,"Lyin’ Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

[Verse 2]
Late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has it's price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

[Verse 3]
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town
[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

[Verse 4]
On the other side of town, a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel

[Verse 5]
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

[Verse 6]
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
[Verse 7]
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

[Verse 8]
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

[Outro]
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes12Embed"
6,Take It to the Limit,"Take It to the Limit Lyrics[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
[Verse 2]
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Outro]
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (C'mon)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (You gotta)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (Come on and)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Ah-ah)
Take it to the limit (Ah-ah)
Take it to the limit one more time

7,The Last Resort,"The Last Resort Lyrics[Verse 1]
She came from Providence
One in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea

[Verse 2]
She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide
[Verse 3]
Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high

[Verse 4]
And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

[Verse 5]
Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And, Jesus, people bought 'em
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun
Sinking in the sea
[Verse 6]
You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did
So many years ago
They even brought a neon sign
""Jesus is coming""
They brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign

[Verse 7]
Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier
But we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs
And justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God

[Verse 8]
And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
And stand up and sing about
What it's like up there
They call it paradise
I don't know why
You call someplace paradise
Kiss it goodbye3Embed"
8,New Kid in Town,"New Kid in Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

[Verse 2]
You look in her eyes, the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while, you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend (Oh)
[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?

[Bridge]
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night, you're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder

[Verse 3]
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

Where you've been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
He's holding her and you're still around

9,Wasted Time,"Wasted Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

[Verse 2]
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember, oh
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
[Chorus 1]
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

[Verse 3]
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell, fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No, no, you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell

[Verse 4]
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To let them go away

[Chorus 2]
And I could've done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worryin' 'bout this wasted time
[Verse 5]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Another love has come and gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
""Sometimes to keep it together
We've got to leave it alone""

[Chorus 3]
So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time8Embed"

Starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round

And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' when
It comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb

Still looks the same

But the words come out too rough

I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine

That we could never rise above

I give you the best of my love

And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

Oh-uh-oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home

We will still come through
[Chorus 2]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run

[Verse 2]
You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

[Chorus 3]
Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'

In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
In the long run
In the long run

18,Doolin-Dalton,"Doolin-Dalton Lyrics[Verse]
They were dueling, Doolin-Dalton
High or low, it was the same
Easy money and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain
Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will
Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now
They're no damn good
Better keep on moving, Doolin-Dalton
Till your shadow sets you free
If you're fast, and if you're lucky
You will never see that hanging tree
Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waiting for the names
And a man could use his back, or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy, Lord, cause nothing ever changed
Until Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap, just biding time
Then he laughed and said, I'm going
And so he left that peaceful life behind

19,Love Will Keep Us Alive,"Love Will Keep Us Alive LyricsI was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

Don't you worry
Sometimes you've just got to let it ride
The world is changing
Right before your eyes

Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do

Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot

[Verse 2]
I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

[Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well
[Verse 3]
Some people never come clean
Oh, I think you know what I mean, oh
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between

[Verse 4]
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
A-this ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends, your been-around-the-world friends
That talk is for losers and fools

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

Hi there, how are you? It's been a long time
Seems like we've come a long way
My, but we learn so slow
And heroes, they come and they go
And leave us behind as if we're supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?

[Verse 2]
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend, it's nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows

23,The Heart of the Matter,"The Heart of the Matter LyricsI got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
... People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, Baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you; life goes on
You keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you inside
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymoreEmbed"

There are stars
In the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees

Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars

I turn on the tube and what do I see?
A whole lot of people crying, ""Don't blame me""
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your mamma's too thin and your daddy's too fat

[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
All this whining and crying and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing
[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
If you don’t wanna play then you might as well quit
Get over it, get over it

It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
You're making the most of your losing streak
Some call it sick, but I call it weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt, you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter, bringing everybody down
You bitch about the present and blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass

Get over it
Get over it
All this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

Same dances in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
There's no telling what a man might use
After the thrill is gone
The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone
What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well
Time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
[Bridge]
You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That ain't no kind of loving at all, well

[Outro]
Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone1Embed"
27,Try and Love Again,"Try and Love Again LyricsWhen you're out there on your own
Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to
One by one the lonely feelings come
Day by day they slowly fade away

Ooh, the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her
Should I stay or go? I really want to know
Would I lose or win if I try and love again?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love

Right or wrong, what's done is done
It's only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well, it might take years
To see through all these tears
Don't let go
When you find it, you will know
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again

There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know

But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no, pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?

Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start

An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

They're looking at you, leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love

Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove

You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

Oh, no, you can't do that

Let's have a little heart to heart

All your talent and my good taste
I'd hate to see it go to waste

Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
In the morning
He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love

And take care of your own

Next day they're gone
I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back""
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

End of the line

Well I finally got around to admit that I might have a problem
But I thought it was just too damn big of a mountain to climb
Well I got down on my knees and said ""Hey

Guess I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time.""

Oh yeah, one day at a time

When I use to put the blame on everybody's shoulders but mine
All the friends I use to run with are gone

Meets a violent farewell

And someday you will

Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom""
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café

[Chorus]
Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

[Verse 2]
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free

[Verse 3]
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why, it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café

36,Waiting in the Weeds,"Waiting in the Weeds Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's coming on the end of August
Another summer's promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long

I don't know when I realized the dream was over
Well, there was no particular hour, no given day
You know, it didn't go down in flame
There was no final scene, no frozen frame
I just watched it slowly fade away

[Chorus 1]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do
[Verse 2]
I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance
Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade

[Chorus 2]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town

[Bridge 1]
And I imagine sunlight in your hair
You're at the county fair
You're holding hands and laughing
And now the ferris-wheel has stopped
You're swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And he's the darling of the chic
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
Baby, what a mess you're making

[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
I've been stumbling through some dark places
Now I'm following the plow
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's alright now

[Chorus 3]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune

[Bridge 2]
The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The egg and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze

Just give me something, something I can use

Come and whisper in my ear, give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleach-blonde who comes on at five
She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die, give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set, we need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone, keep your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around)

Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
Love to cut you down to size, we love dirty laundry

We can do the innuendo, we can dance and sing
When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king, give us dirty laundry
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)...Embed"
38,The Girl from Yesterday,"The Girl from Yesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
It wasn't really sad the way they said good-bye
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away

[Chorus]
And she became the girl from yesterday

[Verse 2]
He took a plane across the sea
To some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away

[Chorus]
And she became the girl from yesterday
[Verse 3]
She doesn't know what's right
She doesn't know what's wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
And she doesn't count the teardrops
That she's cried while he's away
Because she knows deep in her heart
That he'll be back someday

The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone
Talking to a memory that's never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say

[Outro]
But, she'll always be the girl from yesterday[x2]Embed"
39,Train Leaves Here This Morning,"Train Leaves Here This Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well
Have been completely blind

[Chorus 1]
So if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Verse 2]
She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on
[Chorus 2]
But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hanging on
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Verse 3]
""1320 North Columbus"" was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
It might have been that it was getting time to leave

[Chorus 3]
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, ""Lead on""
'Cause there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Outro]
There's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on2Embed"
40,On the Border,"On the Border Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cruising down the center of a two way street
Wondering who is really in the driver's seat
Minding my business along comes big brother
Says, son, you better get on one side or the other

[Chorus]
I'm out on the border, i'm walking the line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

After a hard day, i'm safe at home
Fooling with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in and
Says, ""hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been.""

I'm out on the border, I thought this was a private line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

Never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
Never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard

All I wanted was some peace of mind
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order

I wish you peace when the cold winds blow
Warmed by the fire's glow
I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time
And arms to hold you when you ache inside
I wish you hope when things are going bad
Kind words when times are sad
I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind
Cooling waters at the fever's end

The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low

I wish you the strength to let love grow on
I wish you the strength to let love flow

The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low

42,James Dean,"James Dean LyricsJames Dean, James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look alright
If I could see it on the silver screen
You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen

We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
James Dean, James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean, up on the screen
Wondering who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity

James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen

You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye, bye5Embed"

Tell me , how do you feel?
Like you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels?
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along
We're all trying to get along
With everybody else trying to go their way
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
Just go along until they turn out the lights
There's nothing we can do to fight it

[Chorus]
No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain
And we who must remain go on living just the same

[Verse 2]
I once knew a man, very talented guy
He's sing for the people and people would cry
They knew that his song came from deep down inside
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home

We who must remain go on laughing just the same2Embed"

I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Southern California
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

We may lose and we may win though
But we will never be here again so open up, I'm climbin' in take it easy
Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Well you know we got it easy
We outta take it easy, yeahEmbed"

Springtime, and the acacias are blooming
Southern California will see one more day
Dreamland, and bus'ness is booming
The birds are a singing as I drift away

[Verse 2]
She looks another year older
From too many lovers who used her and ran
But some nights, oh, she looks like an angel
And she's always willing to hold you again

[Chorus]
So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz

Springtime and the lady is grieving
The lovers just stand there with nothing to say
They got what they wanted
They're packing and leaving
To look for another to love the same way

She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz

I went lickety-splitly out to my old fifty-five
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

[Chorus 2]
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a wishing I'd stayed a little longer

Six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me

47,Long Road Out of Eden,"Long Road Out of Eden Lyrics[Verse 1]
Moon shining down through the palms
Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passing by
Galaxies unfolding, new worlds being born
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn
[Chorus]
And it's a long road out of Eden

[Verse 2]
Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
He said, ""Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket!""
""Give me another piece of that pecan pie!""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Freeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune
We're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon
Captains of the old order clinging to the reins
Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains

[Chorus]
But it's a long road out of Eden

[Verse 3]
Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here?
I'm not counting on tomorrow
And I can't tell wrong from right
But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight
[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda
And now we're driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way
He said, ""It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste""
""But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste""

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools
But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools

And it's a long road out of Eden2Embed"

You were barfing all over your girlfriend's shoes

And they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band

No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks

The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing

Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said, ""Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?""
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

The years brought the railroad it ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave?
Go around with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance

Whatever happened to Saturday night
Choosing a friend and losing a fight?
She said, ""Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?""
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

52,Certain Kind of Fool,"Certain Kind of Fool Lyrics[Verse]
He was a poor boy, raised in a small family
He kinda had a craving for something no one else could see
They say that he was crazy, the kind that no lady should meet
He ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
He wants to dance, oh yeah
He wants to sing, oh yeah
He wants to see the lights a flashing
And listen to the thundering
He saw it in a window, the mark of a new kind of man
He kind of liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt it, he knew he could stand with the best
They got respect, oh yeah
He wants the same, oh yeah
And it's a certain kind of fool
Who likes to hear the sound of his own name
A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
He had a reputation spreading like fire through the land
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
It wasn't for the running, but now he's running everydayEmbed"

Sometimes hard to find
Like a rainbow
Well, she's lost all her glory
And could tell you some stories
That we all should know

And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns around

It always seems to turn the tide
At midnight
And for her there is no rest
We are doing what is best
For our future
One of these days she may not
Be so good to you
One of these days she might
Shake you to the ground
But her fire is still
Burning
And her heart is still yearning
To be found

And there's too many hands

61,Out of Control,"Out of Control Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
With the stars all shining down
Well, I can hear the night wind howling
It's a high and lonesome sound
And I ain't had a woman in so long
I can't feed my starving soul
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
We're gonna get a little out of control

[Verse 2]
There's a card game in the corner
And the barmaid smiled at me
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and
She brought me a drink for free
All the town-folk call her the cheap one
And the gamblers call her Flo
Come on, set 'em up again
I got me a friend, and I think I'm getting out of control
Oh, oh, oh
[Bridge]
She's cool water, her mama taught her
I got news, she's mine and mine alone

[Verse 3]
And if anybody's looking for trouble
You know I'm the one you want to try
Well, I'll fight any man who wants to
And I don't care who or why
You got to gamble on your story
You got no guts, you get no glory
And I'm betting my money on an ace in the hole
Think I'm getting out of control

[Outro]
We've done it now
Where's my baby?
Where'd you go, baby?Embed"
62,Midnight Flyer,"Midnight Flyer Lyrics[Chorus]
Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer
I paid my dues and i feel like traveling on

[Verse 1]
A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe
Maybe San Antone
Any town is where I'm bound
Any way to get me gone
Don't think about me
Never let me cross your mind
Except when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine

I paid my dues and I feel like travelin' onEmbed"
63,Busy Being Fabulous,"Busy Being Fabulous Lyrics[Verse 1]
I came home to an empty house
And I found your little note
""Don't wait up for me tonight""
And that was all she wrote
Do you think I don't know that you're out on the town
With all of your high-rolling friends?
What do you do when you come up empty?
Where do you go when the party ends?

[Chorus]
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
I don't know what you were dreaming of
Somehow you forgot about love
And you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh
[Verse 2]
A little time in the country
A day or two to slow down
A bottle of wine and a walk in the moonlight
Maybe some fooling around
But you think time is just a magazine
And money's just a thrill
I've waited so long for you to change your way of living
Now I realize that you never will

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You tell a joke and everybody's laughing
That's something you know how to do
You've always been the life of the party
But now my baby, the joke is on you
Because you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
Running after something that never comes
What in the world are you running from?
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
To drink the wine from your winner's cup
To notice the children were growing up
[Outro]
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy, too busy
Too busy
Aw, babyEmbed"

Open up your eyes
Take the devil from your mind
He's been holding on to you
And you're so hard to find
The wind outside is cold
Restless feeling in my soul
Tempting me to get away
But there's no place a man can go

[Chorus]
God, will you lead me where I roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no

[Verse 2]
You are the one, oh
How could you be so blind?
The devil prays on runaways
He's never far behind
The many years I've tried
Now have been revealed to me
Closer is the love you'll find
Waiting so patiently

Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no

Dancing underneath the flashing light saying

I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm somebody!""
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler

[Verse 2]
He's been around here all along, baby
Been waiting for his time to come
You looking for attention, darling
He will surely give you some
He's the crimson in your face du jour
The fiddler in your darkest night
He's the melody without a cure
And Rome is burning but that's alright

They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far

My Maserati does one-eighty-five
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the trunk
I lock the doors in case I get drunk

I make hit records, my fans they can't wait
They write Tim letters, tell Glenn Don's great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
(Everybody say I'm cool) (He's cool)
I can't complain but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far

I go to parties, sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find some more

Everybody's so different, we're all insane

And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

Twenty-one and strong as I can be
I know what freedom means to me
And I can’t give the reason why
I should ever want to die

Got no cause to be afraid
Or fear that life will ever fade
Because as I watch the rising sun
I know that we have just begun

I might spend my life upon the road
Just trying to add to what I know
Then someday I might settle down
And all my friends will be around

They say a man should have a stock and trade
But me, I'll find another way
I believe in getting what you can
And there ain’t no stopping this young man
[Outro]
Because I'm young and fast as I can be
I know what freedom means to me
And I can’t give the reason why
I should ever want to die
No I can’t give the reason why

Stare out the window
You can't make the time go

Wait for the weekend to go off the deep end
And make everything disappear

You're lost in a teenage jail
So young and so vicious and so frail
Where something is always for sale
You're lost in a teenage jail

[Verse 3: Glenn Frey & Don Henley]
You're not like your mothers (not like your mother!)
You're not like the others (not like the other!)
You're not quite like anyone else (You're not quite like anyone else, no, no)
They don't even know you
Got nothing to show you
So get something good for yourself

73,No More Walks in the Wood,"No More Walks in the Wood LyricsNo more walks in the wood
The trees have all been cut down
And where once they stood
Not even a wagon rut
Appears along the path
Low brush is taking over
No more walks in the wood
This is the aftermath
Of afternoons in the clover fields
Where we once made love
Then wandered home together
Where the trees arched above
Where we made our own weather
When branches were the sky
Now they are gone for good
And you, for ill, and I
Am only a passer-by
We and the trees and the way
Back from the fields of play
Lasted as long as we could
No more walks in the woodEmbed"

You never cry like a lover should
Sigh when it feels real good
Or see the sky through the stone and wood
You never cry like a lover
I thought i saw somebody i loved
Sleeping deep inside you
If i could catch you in an unguarded moment
I'd stay right here beside you
You never smile at me late at night
Laugh out loud when we get it right
You can't get loose if there's too much light
You never smile like a lover
Try a little harder
I can't live with you baby, can't live without it
Try a little harder
And sometimes i believe in love
Sometimes i doubt it
But your life goes on
Like a broken down carousel
Where somebody left the music on
[Bridge]
I was hoping you were the one [x4]

[Outro]
You never move like you used to do
Pour it out when you're feeling blue
Somebody must have put some pain on you

You never cry
(cry like a lover)
Come on and cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry

While our love is falling apart

Tell me you're not leaving now
Tell me you're not leaving

Please say you'll stay with me, baby
Tell me that you love me still
Say you love me still

Fall down on my knees and pray

Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away
Spends his days denying that
He's got no time for flying
In the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
And he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
The going's getting tough
Time is passing by him and he just
Can't get enough
He'll tell you all is going well
Though knows that something's wrong
The earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
Just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
And sets my mind at ease to
Know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please

87,Frail Grasp on the Big Picture,"Frail Grasp on the Big Picture Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, ain't it a shame
'bout our short little memory?
Never seem to learn
The lessons of history
We keep making the same mistakes
Over and over and over and over again
And then we wonder why
We're in the shape we're in

Good old boys down at the bar
Peanuts and politics
They think they know it all
They don't know much of nothing
Even if one of them was to read a newspaper
Cover-to-cover
That ain't what's going on
Journalism dead and gone
[Chorus]
Frail grasp on the big picture
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Dark ages

[Verse 2]
You, my love-drunk friend
All that red wine and candlelight
Soulful conversations
That go on until the dawn
How many times can you tell your story?
How many hangovers can you endure
Just to get some snuggling done?

You're living in a hormone dream
You don't have the slightest notion
What long-term love is all about
All your romantic liaisons
Don't deal with eternal questions like
""Who left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?""
""Whose turn to take the garbage out?""

[Chorus]
Frail grasp on the big picture
You keep on rubbing and you're gonna get a blister
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
And I've seen it all before
[Bridge]
And we pray to our Lord
Who we know is American
He reigns from on high
He speaks to us through middlemen
And he shepherds his flock
We sing out and we praise His name
He supports us in war
He presides over football games
And the right will prevail
All our troubles shall be resolved
We have faith above all
Unless there's money or sex involved

[Chorus]
Frail grasp on the big picture (Nobody)
Nobody's calling and they're roughing up the kicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Heaven help us

Frail grasp on the big picture
All waiting for that miracle elixir
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
I don't wonder anymore

Frail grasp on the big picture (Somebody)
You brought her here so go ahead and kiss her
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Frail grasp on the big picture (Hold on, hold on)
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture

88,The Boys of Summer,"The Boys of Summer LyricsNobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach

Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream

Now I don't understand what
Happened to our love
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and you're
Smiling at everyone

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today I saw a Black Head
Sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back""

I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go, but...
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that top pulled down
And that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that hair slicked back
And those Wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have goneEmbed"
89,All She Wants to Do Is Dance,"All She Wants to Do Is Dance LyricsThey're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, ""Don't come back here, Yankee""
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is danceEmbed"

Great expectations
Everybody's watching you
People you meet
They all seem to know you
Even your old friends

You're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts
That never mend

Will she still love you
When you're not around?

You're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder

That it doesn't really matter
Which side you're on

I come before you with my heart in my hand
Hoping you can see me through this veil of tears
Somehow I've got to make you understand
Ah, don't you know me after all these years?

In everything that comes around again

You will find your way back home

92,Hotel California (Live Millennium Concert Version),"Hotel California (Live Millennium Concert Version) LyricsOn a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive

But you can never leave1Embed"

Look at the weather, look at the news
Look at all the people in denial
We're running time, leaving grace
Still we worship at the marketplace
While common sense is going out of style
I thought that I would be above it all by now
In some country garden in the shade

[Chorus]
But it's business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Just grinding away
You try to be righteous
You try to do good
But business as usual
Turns your heart into wood
[Verse 2]
Monuments to arrogance reach for the sky
Our better nature's buried in the rubble
We got the prettiest White House that money can buy
Sitting up there in that beltway bubble
The main jefe talks about our freedom
But this is what he really means

Business as usual
How dirty we play
Business as usual
Don't you get in the way
Yeah, make you feel helpless
Make you feel like a clown
Business as usual
Is breaking me down

[Verse 3]
Boy, you can't go surfing in Century City
Yeah, them sharks out there are lurking beneath the curb
Yeah, they rob you blind, chew you up, and it ain't pretty
And it's a soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking
Soul sucking, soul sucking world

Business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Feel like walking away
A barrel of monkeys
Or band of renown

Working the crosswords, turn off the phone

It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job
Stay up late with the same old mob

Her hips begin to circle slowly
Her eyes have closed, her face is holy
She holds the whole world in trance

[Chorus]
I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

She likes the slow songs of love lost
They take her a million miles away
Because to dream, sometimes, is the only way
To go places you can't get to any other way
Our eyes connect, she takes my hand

[Verse 3]
I feel my heart beating, and I wonder
Will it ever satisfy my longing?
I'm going to hold on to you for as long as I can
For who knows, this dance may be our only dance

[Bridge]
So we danced together, close and slow
So slow we're almost standing still
Her warm breath against my neck
Slowly breaking down my will
The room spins so I can barely stand
The song ends, then, she lets go of my hand
There's so much I don't understand

99,New York Minute (2),"New York Minute (2) LyricsHarry, got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

He had a home
Love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess, it doesn't matter anymore
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody, going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

In these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
Take care of your own
'Cause one day they're here
Next day they're gone
Pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
He said, ""Baby, I've changed, please, come back""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
I know, the days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty change
In a New York minute

Everything can change
In a New York minute
In a New York minute

In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange

Four that wanna own me

In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well I'm running down the road
Trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover
Who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy

Spent my life runnin' 'round

Somebody's going to hurt someone before the night is through
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately keep on turning out
And burning out and turning out the same
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in still you're coming back
You're running back, you're coming back for more

And take it to the limit one more time

But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin’ on the phone
She said you’d found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, Im learning again
Ive been tryin to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
Theres a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
Theyre the very things - we kill I guess
Pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesnt keep me warm
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought Id figured out
I have to learn again
Ive been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me anymore
There are people in your life whove come and gone
They let you down you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby; life goes on
You keep carryin that anger; itll eat you up inside, baby
Ive been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thought seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me
Ive been tryin to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So Im thinkin about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me
Forgiveness
Forgiveness - baby
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, you dont love me anymore

Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road
There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide
You should go
There is a taste of time sweetened honey
Down the Seven Bridges RoadEmbed"
113,New Kid in Town (Live version),"New Kid in Town (Live version) LyricsThere's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

You look in her eyes; the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while you're looking the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night you're willing to hold her
Just hold her, tears on your shoulder
There's talk on the street; it's there to remind you
It doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you till somebody new comes along
Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?

And he's holding her, and you're still around
Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town, just another new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's walking like the new kid in town

There's a new kid in town. I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town. I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town. There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town. Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town. People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in townEmbed"

High or low, it was the same:
Easy money and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain

Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now, They're no damn good

Better keep on movin', Doolin-Dalton
'Til your shadow sets you free
If you're fast and if you're lucky
You will never see that hangin' tree

Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waitin' for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy, Lord, 'cause nothin' ever changed
'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was workin' cheap, just bidin' time
Then he laughed and said, ""I'm goin'""
And so he left that peaceful life behind

I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows, I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger
Six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger
Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with Lady Luck

We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And stare out at the auburn sky

There's an old man there from the old world
To him, its all the same
Calls all his customers by name

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

You see a lot more meanness in the city
Its the kind that tears you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride
These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Dont worry girl, Im gonna stick by you
And someday soon were gonna get in that car and get outta here

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And gaze out at the auburn sky

Maybe well leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Saçım da soğuk bir rüzgar

Colitaların ılık kokusu

Gökyüzüne yükseliyor

Uzakta bir yerde

Parlak bir ışık gördüm

Kafam ağırlaştı ve görüşüm bulanıklaştı

Gece için durmam gerekti





Orda kapı yolunda duruyordu

Görev zilini duydum

Ve kendi kendime düşündüm

'Bu cennette olabilir, cehennem de'

Sonra kız bir mum yaktı

Ve bana yolu gösterdi

Koridorda sesler vardı

Sanırım şöyle dediklerini duydum






Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz

Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)

Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da çokça oda var

Senenin herhangi bir zamanı (senenin herhangi bir zamanı)

Burda bulabilirsin






Onun aklı mücеvherlerde

Onun Mеrcedes bends'i var

Arkadaş diye çağırdığı

Bir sürü tatlı erkek arkadaşları var

Sahne de nasıl dans ediyorlar

Tatlı yaz terinde

Bazı danslar hatırlanmak içindir

Bazı danslar unutmak





Kaptana seslendim

""Lütfen bana şarabımı getir""

""Biz de 1969'dan beri o içki yok"" dedi

Ve hala o sesler çok uzaklardan çağırıyor

Seni gecenin ortasında uyandırır

Sadece şunu duyman için






Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz

Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)

Çok sevimli bir yüz

Hotel California'da yaşıyorlar

Ne güzel bir süpriz (ne güzel bir süpriz)

Bahanelerinizi getirin






Tavan da aynalar

Buzda büyük pembe şampanya

Ve o dedi ki ""Burada hepimiz sadece kendimizin tutsağız""

Ve ana salonda

Ziyafet için toplandılar

Onu çelik bıçaklarıyla doğradılar

Ama canavarı öldüremezler






Hatırladığım son şey

Kapıya koşutuğumdu

Daha önce olduğum yere giden

Geçidi tekrar bulmalıydım

""Sakinleş"" dedi adam

Varmak için programlandık

""İstediğin zaman çıkış yapabilirsin

Ama asla ayrılamazsın""Embed"

Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely, till I found you

You can go the distance
We'll find out in the long run (in the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (is a strong one)

People talkin' about is
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down we will
Still come through
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run

You know I don't understand why you don't
Treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
'cause all thе debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for lovе?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out in the long run (in the long run)

She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die, give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set, we need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone, keep your dirty laundry

Well, I'm running down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well I'm running down the road
Trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover
Who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me, oh oh oh

Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easyEmbed"

The night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up

And the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat

The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces, its just like a dream

Nobody know where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city

Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood, its in your moves
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye

You were on the run
Tryin' to get away from all the things you'd done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd

'Cause you belong to the city...

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
'Cause you can take it
You belong to the cityEmbed"

But there's nowhere else in sight

When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity, no
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

[Chorus]
In the city

I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better, better
And I can't stay another night

Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear

You say he's a liar and he put out

You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well
Some people never come clean
I think you know what I mean
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between

Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
This ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends
You ""been around the world"" friends
That talk is for losers and fools

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm no
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong , but I'm not

That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love

I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my loveEmbed"
139,Please Come Home For Christmas (Live Millennium Concert Version),"Please Come Home For Christmas (Live Millennium Concert Version) LyricsBells will be ringing this sad sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing ""Silent Night""
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas

If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear

The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and new Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once againEmbed"
140,Funky New Year (Live Millennium Concert Version),"Funky New Year (Live Millennium Concert Version) LyricsWent to a party just last night
Wanted to bring the year in right
Woke up this morning, I don't know how
Last night I was a happy man, but the way I feel right now

It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, aah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

Can't remember when I ever felt worse
Nothing matters and everything hurts
They were passing round the bottle, made me feel brand new
Trouble with the new man he wants a hit too, hit me

It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, aah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Lord, mmh, funky new year
Nurse I'm worse, funky new year
I got to perk up a little, funky new year
My hair hurts, funky new year

It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, aah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

A party baby
Never again, funky new year
Funky new year
Who's shoes are these? Funky new year
Funky new year
Party hardy baby, funky new year
Funky new year
What year is this anyway?Embed"
