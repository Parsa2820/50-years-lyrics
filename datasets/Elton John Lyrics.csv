0,Your Song,"Your Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world54Embed"

She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home

Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

3,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Lyrics[Verse 1]
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums
[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

5,I’m Still Standing,"I’m Still Standing Lyrics[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
[Verse 3]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free

7,Can You Feel the Love Tonight (End Title),"Can You Feel the Love Tonight (End Title) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?

8,Candle in the Wind,"Candle in the Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid

And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
[Verse 3]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid

9,Crocodile Rock,"Crocodile Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will

Wanna get a belly full of beer

And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me!""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting

17,Someone Saved My Life Tonight,"Someone Saved My Life Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)
[Piano riff]

[Verse 2]
I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

[Chorus]
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Bridge]
And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone
[Chorus]
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

""Spanish Harlem"" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

They know not if it's dark outside or light

This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found

Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

[Chorus 1]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, ""Believe in the Lord"" is the golden rule

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one
[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one

Can I just ask you, Billy
What does it feel like when you're dancing?

[BILLY]
I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free
It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
But the music is impossible, impossible to hear
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

Electricity, sparks inside of me

Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, ""I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day""

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life

With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

[Verse 3]
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water2Embed"
33,I Want Love,"I Want Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Verse 2]
And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
[Verse 3]
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Bridge]
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
[Chorus]
I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love5Embed"
34,Pinball Wizard,"Pinball Wizard Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2]
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
[Post-Chorus]
(How do you think he does it?) I don't know
(What makes him so good?)

[Verse 3]
Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 2]
He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand

[Bridge]
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)

[Verse 4]
Even on my usual table, he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
[Chorus 1]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Chorus 3]
He's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more, he's scoring more

[Chorus 4]
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him, to himEmbed"
35,My Strongest Suit,"My Strongest Suit Lyrics[AMNERIS]
In life, one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
There's health, and fitness, diet, and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice
Conversation? Wit? I am a doubter
Manners? Charm? They're no way to impress
So forget the inner me, observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress

Oh, now I believe in lookin'
Like my time on earth is cookin'
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fiber on of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect
From your cradle via trousseau
To your deathbed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
For my dress has always been...my strongest suit

(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)

Staying in or hitting town-wards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time (Is stitched in time)
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously is a crime (It's such a crime)

And the few who are invited (Overwear)
To my wardrobe are delighted (Underwear)
As they wander through my things (Anytime)
To find en route (We're wandering through your things)
That in negligee or formal (Negligee)
I am anything but normal (Anything but normal)
And dress has always been my strongest suit

(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I am what I wear
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I said anytime...
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
Anywhere
So bring me all my finest (Finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
(Most arresting) Most arresting
(Most heartstopping) Most heartstopping
Most free-flowing (Overwear)
Most eye-popping (Underwear)
Most arresting (Anytime)
Most heartstopping, yeah (Anywhere)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear

Dress has always been my strongest suit!

So bring me all my finest (My finest)

37,Indian Sunset,"Indian Sunset LyricsAs I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns

Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?

I take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole1Embed"
38,Skyline Pigeon,"Skyline Pigeon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again
[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very, so very far behindEmbed"
39,Sad Songs (Say So Much),"Sad Songs (Say So Much) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

[Chorus]
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much
[Verse 2]
If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

[Chorus]
So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

Turn on those sad songs (sad songs)
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)

40,Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
""Two teas both with sugar please"", in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and ""Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?""

[Chorus 1]
Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning
[Chorus 2]
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

[Verse 2]
And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

[Chorus 2]
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

Out for the count and when we're down

Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!

So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you

Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher

Cos it's one day closer to your death

And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher

And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress

All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

48,We All Fall in Love Sometimes,"We All Fall in Love Sometimes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Verse 2]
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
[Chorus 1]
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
""Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?""

And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

50,Grey Seal,"Grey Seal Lyrics[Intro with piano lead]

[Verse 1]
Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, ""Good day"" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 2]
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye
[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 3]
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal3Embed"

[Verse 1]
It's never too late to turn things around
Recover, unravel the path to confound
The doubters and losers that line up despair
Will tell you it's over, you're going nowhere
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late

[Verse 2]
It's never too late to get back on track
To get at least some, if not all of it back
I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was
The sadness is just as important because
Got to carry the weight and hope
It's never too late
[Chorus]
Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

[Post-Chorus]
[Swahili]

[Verse 3]
It's never too late to get up off the ground
Don't have to be noticed, don't have to crowned
I get what I done and I don't try to hide
I lost many things, but never my pride
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late

[Chorus]
Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late
[Post-Chorus]
[Swahili]

[Bridge]
I used to say I don't have time, I'm sleepin' tonight
A day doin' nothin' is doin' it right
No hurry, no Harry, take as long as it takes
You might as well sleep for all the difference it makes
I didn't find love or the peace or the breaks
These aren't excuses, but a string of mistakes
I won't go back there, not goin' back there

[Chorus]
Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Never too late to fight the fight, babe
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

52,The Last Song,"The Last Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

[Chorus]
Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son
[Verse 2]
Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

[Chorus]
Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his sonEmbed"

Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way

Oh, and it hurts like hell to see my girl messin' with a muscle boy
No Superman gonna ruin my plans

54,The Gods Love Nubia,"The Gods Love Nubia Lyrics[AIDA]
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance

In the sway of somber music
I shall never, never understand
Let me slip into the sweeter
Chorus of that other land

The gods love Nubia
The beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile
The gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia
Is only for the moment
The desolate the suffering
The plundered, the oppressed
[NEHEBKA]
The gods love Nubia
Their glorious creation
Its songs roll sweetly
Across the harvest plain

[AIDA, NEHEBKA]
The tears of Nubia
A passing aberration
They wash into the river
And are never cried again

[NEHEBKA, AIDA, MEREB, NUBIAN WOMEN]
The gods love Nubia
We have to keep believing
The scattered and divided
We are still its heart
The fall of Nubia
Ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning
Though the flesh is torn apart

[ALL]
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance
The gods love Nubia
The beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile
The gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia
Is only for the moment
The desolate the suffering
The plundered, the oppressed

The gods love Nubia
We have to keep believing
Though scattered and divided
We are still it's heart
The fall of Nubia
Ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning
Though the flesh is torn apart
My spirit will keep on burning
Though the flesh is torn -

55,This Song Has No Title,"This Song Has No Title Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

[Chorus]
And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune
[Verse 2]
Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

[Chorus]
And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune1Embed"
56,Sweet Painted Lady,"Sweet Painted Lady LyricsI'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright

So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Forget us, we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said

So as she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same

For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travellers to go

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right
Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light

58,Easy As Life,"Easy As Life Lyrics[AIDA]
This is the moment when
The gods expect me to beg for help
But I won't even try
I want nothing in the world
But myself to protect me
And I won't lie down, roll over, and die

All I have to do is forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic
Would have died

It's easy, it's easy
All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start
It's easy, it's easy

Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him
And how he would have been, were I to be with him today
Those very rare occasions don't let up, they keep on coming
All I've ever wanted and I'm throwing it away
It's easy, it's easy as life

But then I see the faces of a worn, defeated people
A father and a nation who won't let a coward run
Is this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages?
Forcing us to move and they're the hardest things we've done
They're easy, so easy

And though I'll think about him
'Til the earth draws in around me
And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love
This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption
Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above
It's easy, it's easy as life
It's easy as life
It's easy as life!Embed"
59,Every Story Is A Love Story,"Every Story Is A Love Story Lyrics[AMNERIS]
Every story, tale or memoir
Every saga or romance
Whether true or fabricated
Whether planned or happenstance

Whether sweeping through the ages
Casting centuries aside
Or a hurried brief recital
Just a thirty-minute ride

Whether bright or melancholy
Rough and ready, finely spun
Whether with a thousand players
Or a lonely cast of one
Every story, new or ancient
Bagatelle or work of art
All are tales of human failing
All are tales of love at heart

This is the story of a love that flourished in a time of hate
Of lovers no tyranny could separate
Love set into motion on the Nile's shore
Destiny ignited by an act of war

Egypt saw the mighty river
As its very heart and soul
Source of life for all her people
That only Egypt could control
Destruction of her southern neighbor justified
Nubia exploited, left with little more than pride
Ohhh...Embed"

Everything crumbles sooner or later

Families together kill someone

61,Written in the Stars,"Written in the Stars Lyrics[Verse 1: Elton John]
I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple, really, isn't it? A word or two, and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

[Verse 2: LeAnn Rimes]
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me, and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day
[Verse 3: Elton John, LeAnn Rimes, & both]
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
Oh, in which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

[Chorus: Elton John, LeAnn Rimes, both, & choir]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say (In which we have no say)
In which we're given paradise (Given paradise)

Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?

[Chorus]
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
[Verse 2]
We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age

[Chorus]
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is inEmbed"
63,Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny),"Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny) Lyrics[Verse 1]
What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

[Verse 3]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?""

Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?

Hello, baby, hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know?

Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!

Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea

When you think I don't have a clue
Baby, you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

[Chorus]
The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well, their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting

It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blueprint for all of your B-films

Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, oh, with the knives in their eyes

68,Dirty Little Girl,"Dirty Little Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs

[Pre-Chorus]
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

[Verse 2]
Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

It's knowing what they want of me that scares me

It's knowing that each person there compares me
To those in my past whom I now succeed
But how can whatever I do for them now be enough?
Be enough

All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do

Your robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect
Instead of this ragged concoction of thread
But may you be moved by its desperate beauty
To give us new life, for we'd rather be dead
Then live in the squalor and shame of the slave
To the dance!

Beyond my fulfillment, but they won't hear

And if I can rekindle our ancestors' dreams, it's enough

Way behind the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground

[Chorus 1]
My reign will be a super awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna be a noble king
And scrupulously fair
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
[Chorus 2]
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

[Verse 3]
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way (eheeee)

The time has come as someone said
To talk of many things
May be true
But I would rather stick to talking kings
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine

You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore
[Verse 2]
You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

[Bridge]
When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breakin' down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground
[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

But this train don't stop

Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

[Chorus]
Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
[Verse 2]
Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

[Chorus]
Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens

Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range

Being who you want to be?

Emphasise integrity

Cos what the hell is wrong with expressing yourself
For wanting to be me?

If you wanna be a miner, mine
If you want to dress like somebody else
Fine, fine, fine

It's not a big statement, it's not a weird act
Just a good idea at the time
We'll not complain about your boring life
If you'll just leave me to mine
If you wanna be a dancer, dance
If you wanna be a miner, mine

For over seventy years miners of Durham County have come together once a year for their demonstration and gala day. This was the first Durham rally since the pits handed over to the people. This year one of the popular attraction was Mr. Herbert Morrison, who spoke of the link of solidarity between miners and other workers

I want you men of the pits to come through. I want these streets clean of nationalization to succeed triumphantly. The whole country is watching to see how this great new organization, this new adventure, this new experiment, comes out. The great experiment of socialism in a democracy depends on you. The whole future we are trying to conduct in our country is for all our people and all our children, and it depends on you

And although they'll try to break you
And although you'll feel alone
We will always stand together
In the dark, right through the storm
We will stand, shoulder to shoulder
To keep us warm
And the stars look down on the mean and hungry
And the stars look down and show the way
And the stars look down and we'll stand together
To see a day
When the stars look down and know our history
When the stars look down upon our past
And the stars look down and see a future bright at last
When we'll stand as one, beneath the sun

And though our hands are bruised and bleeding
And our lungs are full with dust
And our hearts are near to breaking
We will never forgo the trust
We will fight through pain and hunger
Every arrow, every knife
And we will never give the hope up

There is sod-all left for you here

Now piss off before I start to cry

We dreamt of justice and of men renewed
All people equal, in all things

We know the first will soon be last
And in the ground we may be lain
But a seed is sown to rise again
So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one

And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

Each pain relieved, each hunger fed
Each man revered, each tyrant killed
Each soul redeemed, each life fulfilled

From each man's means to each his need
We saw a time man would be freed
We fought for all the things we saw
The battle's lost but not the war
So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go
We will go down but our heads are proud
We will go down with our voices loud
We will go down but come again
And we all go together when we go

We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go
We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we goEmbed"
79,Sixty Years On,"Sixty Years On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who'll walk me down to church
When I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me
Has been ten years in the grave
And señorita play guitar
Play it just for you
My rosary has broken
And my beads have all slipped through

[Verse 2]
You've hung up your great coat and
You've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in
Wasn't too much fun
[Chorus]
And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'll sit with you and talk
Let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers
Would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ
Plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low
When you are passing through

[Chorus]
And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on1Embed"
80,My Father’s Gun,"My Father’s Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]
From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun

[Chorus]
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
[Verse 2]
As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

[Chorus]
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company, it needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
Oh
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat
The riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said now, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

82,Bad Side of the Moon,"Bad Side of the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

[Chorus]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

[Verse 2]
There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 1]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

83,Enchantment Passing Through,"Enchantment Passing Through Lyrics[RADAMES]
To sail away to half discovered places
To see the secrets so few eyes have seen
To see moments of enchantment on our faces
The moments when we smile and those in between

[AIDA]
If I could leave this place then I'd be sailing
To corners of my land where there would be
Sweet southern winds of liberty prevailing
The beauty so majestic and so free

[RADAMES, spoken]
I will take you sailing, South.  You can be my guide
(sung)
There'd be no ties of time and space to bind me
[AIDA]
And no horizon I could not pursue

[RADAMES]
I'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind me

[AIDA]
I'd put my faith and trusting in something new

[BOTH]
But why should I tell you this

[AIDA]
A stranger I just met

[RADAMES]
A woman whom I hardly know at all and should forget

[BOTH]
A journey we can only dream of
Enchantment passing through
And how is it I say these things
So easily to you

[RADAMES, spoken]
I'll never take you sailing!  I might never  leave Egypt again!
[AIDA, spoken]
You talk as though you've been enslaved!  If you don't like your fate, change it!  You are your own master, there are no shackles on you!  So don't expect any pity or understanding from this humble palace slave!

[RADAMES]
And why did I tell her this?
A stranger I've just met
A woman who I hardly know at all and will forget
Anonymous and gone tomorrow
Enchantment passing through
And all I've done is tell her things
She already knew
She knew ...She knew....Embed"
84,Social Disease,"Social Disease Lyrics[Verse 1]
My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

[Chorus]
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease
[Verse 2]
My landlady lives in a caravan
Well, that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

[Chorus]
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

[Verse 2]
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

Snow, cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters tracking down the hours

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die?

[Chorus]
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no
[Verse 2]
Junk, angel
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription for a brand new heart attack

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied?

86,Elaborate Lives,"Elaborate Lives Lyrics[RADAMES]
We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be
Slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out, take others in
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you
Now and forever, peaceful, true

This may not be the moment
To tell you face to face
But I could wait forever
For the perfect time and place

[AIDA and RADAMES]
We all lead such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives
Hard to know who's loving who

[AIDA]
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that

[RADAMES]
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to touch your heart

87,I Know the Truth,"I Know the Truth Lyrics[AMNERIS]
How have I come to this?
How did I slip and fall?
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all?

This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far
I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
It's flown just a little too far

Why do I want him still?
Why when there's nothing there?
How to go on with the rest of my life
To pretend I don't care

This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late

Too lateEmbed"
88,The Past Is Another Land,"The Past Is Another Land Lyrics[AIDA]
You know nothing about me and care even less
How could you understand our emptiness?
You've plundered our wisdom, our knowledge, our wealth
In bleeding us dry, you long for our spirit
But that, you will never possess

The past is now another land, far beyond my reach
Invaded by insidious foreign bodies, foreign speech
Where timeless joys of childhood lie broken on the beach

The present is an empty space between the good and bad
A moment's leading nowhere, too pointless to be sad
But time enough to lay to waste every certainty I had

The future is a barren world from which I can't return
Both heartless and material its wretched spoils, not my concern
Shining like an evil sun as my childhood treasures burn
Shining like an evil sun as my childhood treasures burnEmbed"

But you won't catch me carvin' up my love

I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears

And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

Did you paint your smile on, well, I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control

91,Ticking,"Ticking Lyrics[Verse 1]
""An extremely quiet child"" they called you in your school reports
""He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught""
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died
At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
""Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win""
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

[Chorus]
""Now you'll never get to Heaven"" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking
[Verse 2]
They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said ""His brain's just snapped"" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground
Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh your childhood cried out in your head ""they mean to do you harm""

[Chorus]
""Don't ever ride on the devil's knee"" Mama said
Remember mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

[Verse 3]
Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule
Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
""Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high""
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law
[Chorus]
""You've slept too long in silence"" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head""

Long before the rain starts falling

[Verse 2]
Tonight, does it have to be the old thing?
Tonight, oh, it's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise, ooh, and place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
Oh, and I cannot find the time

Tonight, just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight, why not approach with less defiance?
The man who'd love to see you smile
Who'd love to see you smile tonight

The script not followed then was awfully long

The acting right, not actin' up

I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
[Verse 3]
Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinkin' 'bout
Time is wasted lookin' back

Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

96,It’s Tough to Be a God,"It’s Tough to Be a God Lyrics[Verse 1: Elton John]
I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on its knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

[Verse 2: Randy Newman]
Listen, if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes I
Can see us being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feeling should not be rebuffed
[Chorus: Elton John, Elton John & Randy Newman]
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle
If he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

[Verse 3: Elton John]
All the same, it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force them to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams, so follow me!

[Verse 4: Randy Newman]
Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth?
Why don't we just say, ""some other time""?
[Chorus: Elton John, Elton John & Randy Newman]
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation
Every Sunday score a ten
The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise, paradiseEmbed"
97,The Greatest Discovery,"The Greatest Discovery Lyrics[Verse]
Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch
A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore
Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded, must be displayed
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing
In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent's smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend
And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother[x3]Embed"

The great divide

Who's to say who's right or wrong?
Whose course is braver run?

It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain

[Chorus]
Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
[Verse 3]
Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed

[Verse 4]
And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right

[Chorus]
Oh, I make you mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
[Electric Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
Oh! You make me mellow
Oh! You make me mellow
Rocking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow timeEmbed"
100,Burn Down the Mission,"Burn Down the Mission Lyrics[Verse 1]
You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me?
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody now, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

[Chorus]
Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside
[Verse 2]
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn, down the mission walls

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

[Chorus]
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside1Embed"

102,Better Off Dead,"Better Off Dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

[Verse 2]
Well, they've locked up their daughters
And they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease-streaked windows of an all-night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street
[Chorus]
'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say ""inspired""
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

Ooh (Ooh)

Ooh (La, la, la)

No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

[Chorus]
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die
[Verse 2]
Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose
And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me, yeah
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in?
Should I cry sanctuary?

[Chorus]
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die, yeah!
The king must die
The king must die, oh, yeah

'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon

In the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch
And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room

[Chorus]
""Come down in time"", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
""Come down in time"" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get
And I, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call
And I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

""Come down in time"", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
""Come down in time"" was the message she gave

Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

[Chorus 1]
I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside
[Chorus 2]
Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

[Verse 2]
A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand

107,Written in the Stars (Broadway),"Written in the Stars (Broadway) Lyrics[AIDA]
I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me and wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

[RADAMES]
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Or some god's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day
[AIDA, spoken]
Marry the princess, Radames.  You can help my people, this could be our chance to do something important!  Don't you see?

(sung)
Nothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide

[RADAMES]
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned

[BOTH]
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

[AIDA]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time

[BOTH]
Or some god's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a dayEmbed"

You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same

[Chorus]
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird
[Verse 2]
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away

[Chorus]
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down

We mocked the grave
We moved into uncharted lands

Fortune favors the brave

The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore

Nothing is an accident

It's in ourselves to rise or fall
This is easy to believe
When distant places call to me
It's harder from the palace yard

Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well, she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home

Down at the well, they got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah, but that ain't natural, yeah, well, so old Clay would say
You see, he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying across the sticks
The hedgehogs done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chairs are creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

[Chorus]
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown

Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

How does it feel to know you can't go home

I'm going on the circuit
I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song, boys
To stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me
Just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney
Oh, could you knock a line or two
Together for a friend?
Sentimental, tear-inducing
With a happy end
And we need a tune to open
Our season at Southend
Can you help us?
[Chorus]
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

[Verse 2]
I like the warm blue flame
The hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles
And forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run
From the tin pan alley twins
And there's a chance that one day
You might write a standard, lads
So churn them out quick and fast
And we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get
To launch another dozen acts
Are you working?

[Chorus]
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers

While you've been away cavorting
Matters here have moved apace
Now I need you home supporting
All the plans I've put in place

First of all this means your wedding
You'll recall your future bride
For the way that Pharaoh's heading
Time's no longer on our side

According to the hawk god, Horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid!
There are many who'll be tearful
As our leader fades away
But our architects are cheerful
And each dog must have its day

If our country is to flourish
Then my son must take the lead
Be our inspiration, nourish

That before the corpse is cold

Egypt's glory strength and style
We shall have our finest hour
Far beyond the mighty Nile

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
Build another pyramid!

If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well, don't you try to stop me, I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned

[Chorus]
Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

Well, if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two-wheel combination
And I swear it's gonna be the death of me

She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her

Turn me inside out if you have to, baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy

[Verse 2]
You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my head 'cause I, I love you all the same

With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
Well I don't know if I like that idea much
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
Think all of us boys here are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red

So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die

And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die
[Verse 2]
How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues
Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high

I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

[Chorus]
So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time

Cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile

It's all around the school that I love you
I love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes
Always unprepared for your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
They say it isn't real but I know what I feel and I love you

Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down

Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?""

And this is what I should have said

Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did

And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her weddin' day
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt

I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero

It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack

I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep

The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye

The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid
And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true

We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights
Seems quite unbelievable to me

I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be
Slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't  all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out take others in
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to keep your heart
May this confession be the start

I know you'll give me courage
To face what I must face
With all these complications
In another time and place

We all lead such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true

I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
You witnessed our abduction, which possibly explains
How I know you
How I know you

Before that fateful morning, my family enjoyed
A privileged existence, for my father was employed
As advisor to the King, no less, which surely rings a bell
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell
How I know you
Yes, I know you

[AIDA]
You know too much, and what you say is better left unknown
And now I'm just a slave like you, our lives our not our own

I never have abandoned, and nor I think could you
That spark of hope for freedom no terror can subdue

Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense

Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming
[Verse 2]
See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

And never lifted a finger
Times were hard, but the swine rolled back pissed
So we'd fight and he'd swing and he rarely missed
So I'd clobber the sod when he couldn't resist:
Asleep, you can't lift a finger
But we'd go dancing
And he'd hold me tight
He was air, He was water, He was breath, He was light
And he would hold me there, with all his might
And it was bliss for an hour or so
But then they called time to go
And in the morning we were sober

O he'd drink and he'd talk just like a fool
Lie like a bairn and snore like a mule
Rarely was sober, pretty much was the rule
And he never lifted a finger
I suppose times were hard, things were different then
Women were women and men, they were men
Seventeen, that was it, your life ended when you had a ring around your finger

But we'd go dancing, he was me own Brando
And for a moment there my heart was a-glow
We had dust in our hair and nowhere to go
Boo we were free for an hour or three
From the people we had to be
But in the morning we were sober

But if I went through my time again
Oh I'd do it without the help of men
Or at least your Grandad
But then again, you know
Best not to linger
What is the use of dreaming now?
I had my chance, well anyhow
If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd've given them all the finger

And gone dancing, and not give a shit
And spin around and reel and love each bit
And I'd dance alone and enjoy it
And I'd be me for an entire life
Instead of somebody's wife
And I never would be sober
And I never would be soberEmbed"
135,Teacher I Need You,"Teacher I Need You LyricsI was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean, she's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me
It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration for my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you
I have to write a letter, ooh
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention on some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees
Oh, so I'm sitting in the classroom, woo!
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances, I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need youEmbed"
136,Ballad of a Well-Known Gun,"Ballad of a Well-Known Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]
I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And I hung my head in shame

[Chorus]
Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun
[Verse 2]
Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord, I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

[Chorus]
Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

[Chorus]
Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me

There goes a well-known gun

Lord, I say, now they've found me

137,Deep Into The Ground,"Deep Into The Ground Lyrics[JACKIE ELLIOT/DAD]
Oh once I was a young man
Looked over vales and hills
Saw myself a future
Of riches and of thrills
But on me fifteenth birthday
I paid my union dues
And they sent me deep into the ground

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh once I had a family
Sons to make you proud
They have gone and left me now
And I count the time out loud
For now, I am an old man
Just waiting for my turn
Till they take me back into the ground
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever
And I won't leave them until I die

Oh once I loved a woman
She meant all the world to me
Saw ourselves a future
As far as I could see
But I was only forty-seven
When they took her down from me
And buried her deep

[BILLY]
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever
And I won't leave them until I die

There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps

[Chorus]
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up

Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance

Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

[Chorus]
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
[Verse 2]
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design

Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man before the child
On the trail we blazeEmbed"
141,First Episode at Hienton,"First Episode at Hienton Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you

[Chorus]
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

[Verse 2]
No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes, they were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please don't be sad where ever you are
I am who I am
You are who you are

That they should ask

Would they criticize
Behind my back
Maybe I should let them

Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

[Verse 2]
If they could face it
I could take it
In their eyes
Oh, I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it
[Chorus]
Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

[Bridge]
But I know the way
They want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn
Their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

143,"Like Father, Like Son","Like Father, Like Son Lyrics[ZOSER]
Don't come on so cocksure boy
You can't escape your genes
No point in feeling pure boy
Your background intervenes
Listen good and listen straight
You're not the master of your fate
To this you must be reconciled
You'll always be your father's child
At times acclaimed, at times reviled
You'll wind up doing just what I've done
Like father, like son

[RADAMES]
Don't assume your vices
Get handed down the line
That a parent's blood suffices
To condemn the child's design
I've done wrong, I can't deny
But at least I know that I
Shouldn't blame that on my stock
This may come as quite a shock
I'm no chip off any block
I wouldn't wish those words on anyone
Like father, like son
[ZOSER]
Son you're nervous, take my hand
All is settled, all is planned
You've got the world at your command
I don't think you understand

[RADAMES]
I appreciate too well
The squalor at which you excel
It isn't very hard to tell
Evil's a distinctive smell

(RADAMES storms off, leaving ZOSER horrified.)

[ZOSER]
He's lost all sense of reason, and why?
Some foreign slut
Not only is that treason
Some doors are slamming shut
Just like me he's found that flesh
Can excite but will enmesh
Once we rid him of this blight
Once that harlot's out of sight
Then I think he'll see the light
He won't walk back to daddy
He will run

144,Live Like Horses,"Live Like Horses Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me
[Chorus]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses

[Verse 2]
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

[Pre-Chorus]
On the flat, dry desert, I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now, I shall be free

[Chorus]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

I'm not a rat to be spat on, locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings, take me high above

[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

[Verse 2]
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems, oh, so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love
[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, fly!

[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, yeah

Hey, the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man, yeah

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

I’m countin' on a memory to get me outta here
I’m waitin' for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I’ve spent bein' someone else’s friend
Just one more time, for old time’s sake, I’d like to go back home again

[Verse 2]
The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It’s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline
And all around me, I’ve seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I’d say amen if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

Could've been a jailbreak and the spotlight hittin' me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia on the coast of Spain
Never tirin' once of hearin' songs about goin' home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end

Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

Sparks inside of me

Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell

It's like that there's some music
Playing in your ear
But the music is impossible
Impossible to hear

You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Round a tree in the summer, a fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand

Passed on from hand to hand

And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me, I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs a-hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling, she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows
[Verse 2]
Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare
Of undue concern, he said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember?
Can I still shoot a fast cue?
Has this country kid still got his soul?

[Chorus]
Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money

We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two

Look at your face
That's the measure of a man

This coat that fits you like a glove
These dirty streets you learned to love
So welcome back my long lost friend
You've been to hell and back again
God alone knows how you crossed that span
Back on the beat, back to the start
Trust in your heart
That's the measure of a man

It's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
It's the things you understand
Permanent ties from which you once ran
That's the measure of a man

You've come full circle, now you're home
Without the gold, without the chrome
And this is where you've always been
You had to lose so you could win
And rise above your troubles while you can

Now you can love, now you can lose
Now you can choose

So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed

[Verse 2]
I left from the dockland two years ago now
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
Rotten peaches are all that I see

[Chorus]
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

[Verse 3]
There ain't no green grass in the U.S. state prison
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
For I lie in the light of the Lord
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
And I guess I won't see it no more

[Chorus]
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the
Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sunEmbed"

I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed

[Chorus]
It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation
A chance to put the devil down
Without the fear of hell
Salvation spreads the gospel 'round
And free you from yourself

You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Blind, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me

Is this a game?
Are you just playin'?
Will I be losin' you?

And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be

157,Please,"Please Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've been crippled in love
Short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls
A slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you
[Verse 2]
We've been living with sorrow
Been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings
A little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Bridge]
But tied to the same track
The two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times
Can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread
[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please

I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird some days
Had a place where I could land
I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said?
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again
[Chorus]
And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

[Verse 2]
I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drown in your eyes
I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold

[Pre-Chorus]
But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You got to wade into the water
You got to learn to live again

Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon

And made El Dorado

But all this was granted
For only one millenium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the Gods
Will approve of us still
Preserve El Dorado

And I believe they will

Are her disguise
Her secrets are safe from foreign hands
And eyes forever

Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill
Oh there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry

[Chorus]
Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying ""Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend""

Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down
And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh, it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home

[Chorus]
Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying ""Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Ooh, sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend""

I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner
In the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
Ooh! Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims and the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain, no regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

[Verse 2]
Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so?
Ain't that so?

Tall in the wind, she's simple and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children and she's been my lover

Once you've been bitten, you get excited

She comes for coffee, and my mama asked me

So where's the shoorah she sang?
You know I hear it again, my friend

Waiting to sing her back

163,Son of Your Father,"Son of Your Father Lyrics[Verse 1]
""I'll catch the tram line in the morning
With your leave"", Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said, ""You'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm""
Van Bushell saw a hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said, ""Now calm you down, my brother
Let's discuss this man to man""
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage
[Pre-Chorus]
You're the son of your father
You try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you

[Chorus]
With blood and water, bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own

[Verse 2]
Well, slowly Joseph barely lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell, he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said, ""Now, hey, blind man, that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride""
Well, Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said, ""Let me just refresh your mind
Your manners, boy, seem hard to find""

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm
So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the son of your father
Oh, try a little bit harder
You gotta do for me as he would do for you

Brave, intrepid, and then some
Pioneers of maximum audacity whose résumés
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-La
The Promised Land
Seventh Heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man, behold the child
On the trail we blaze

The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveller to be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding

We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds
It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

[Verse 2]
I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf
But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas

Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear

Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have

Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
And every one of us that ever came to play

Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide

[Verse 3]
Well, it's time I moved off
But it's been great just listening to you
And I might even see ya next time I'm passing through
You're right, there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
So keep well, keep well old friend
And have another drink on me
Just ignore all the others
You got your memories
You got your memoriesEmbed"
175,I Feel Like a Bullet (in the Gun of Robert Ford),"I Feel Like a Bullet (in the Gun of Robert Ford) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

[Chorus]
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford
[Verse 2]
Like a child when his toy's been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law [x2]

176,Friends Never Say Goodbye,"Friends Never Say Goodbye LyricsThere isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been, will ever be as one

What is done hath been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy, the same sadness, each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbyeEmbed"
177,Grimsby,"Grimsby Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

[Chorus]
Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers
[Verse 2]
Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay

178,A Word in Spanish,"A Word in Spanish Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen
[Chorus]
And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

[Verse 2]
If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

[Pr-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue

The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs
Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

[Chorus]
You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers
And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

You can come to Val-hala in your own time

I don't want to wake you
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent
Upon your feather pillow
For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing
And her silence keeps us guessing

[Chorus]
Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands
[Verse 2]
You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul
For there's toast and honey
And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
Oh it's ten below zero
And we're about to abandon our plans for the day

As if our love were new

Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields

We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be

Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

It was tearing me apart
We're lost, we're finished man, we're through
I need to give the kid a future
I need to look him in the eye
Believe me son I'd do the same for you

[TONY]
But you can't give in now Dad
We've all been out a year
I can never talk to you again
You can't do this to me Dad
You can't do it to yourself

We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give
And no one else can give what I can give
He could go and he could shine
Not just stay here counting time
Son we've got the chance to let him live
Yes, we've got the chance to let him live

This isn't about us Dad
It's not about the kid
It's all of us, it's everybody's chance
It's everybody's future
It's everybody's past
It's not about a bairn who wants to dance
It's about our history
It's about our rights
Think about the sacrifice we've made
It's what you always taught us since I was a lad
Please, Dad, don't let that passion fade

And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part-time love

There's not much I don't a-hear of, and a-still, you try
Tellin' me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doin' it too
Because you, me and everybody's got a part-time love

Baby, if you keep on stallin'
Oh, how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part-time love

I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction with you, my love
Whatever I do, you raise the same objection

But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part-time love

I'm waitin', I'm waitin' all the time
And it's gettin' so frustratin'

We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide

[Chorus]
And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there

The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal

You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars

Can't help feeling I've been showin' my friends around
I've seen it growin' from next to nothin'
Into a giant, eatin' up your town
Called up the tea leaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands, oh yeah
She saw a mountain and wild deer runnin'
A crazy kid becoming a better man

[Pre-Chorus]
But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waitin' to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasin' the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine, silk suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt
[Chorus]
And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', ""Truth for sale""
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

[Verse 2]
We've been missin', at times, in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you, oh yeah
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh, we've conjured up what we created
Way back then, when I was standin' up in six-inch heels
Now you're ridin' off into the sunset
And I'm still spinnin' like a Catherine wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
But we stuck around for the battle
Waitin' for a plan
To turn you into the brown dirt cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Diggin' into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots
[Chorus]
And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', ""Truth for sale""
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

No, you can't go back
And if you try, it fails

187,Eminem - Rolling Stone Entry,"Eminem - Rolling Stone Entry LyricsWhen Eminem and I did ""Stan"" at the Grammys in 2001, we got together to rehearse out in the Valley. We had never met or really spoken, so I was a little intimidated. When we started to do the song and Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, ""Fuck, this man is amazing."" There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time — only the greats.

Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out. That's why we look forward to listening to Eminem's lyrics and finding out where the hell he's headed next.

Eminem lives, sleeps and breathes music — he's a bit like me in that respect. He's pretty much a recluse. I think he's enthralled with what he's doing; he's intimately involved with his art. There's a mystique about him. From the start, I have always admired Eminem's thinking. That's the reason I wanted to appear on the Grammys with him when I was asked, despite all the nonsense talked about his being homophobic and crap like that. The Boy Georges of the world all got up in a twist about it. If they didn't have the intelligence to see his intelligence, that was their problem.

Eminem has the balls to say what he feels and to make offensive things funny. That's very necessary today, when irony is becoming a lost art. Artists like Eminem who use their free speech to get a point across are vitally important. There just aren't many people in the world with balls that big and talent that awesome.1Embed"

Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head
The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away

[Chorus]
And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
Because she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies
[Verse 2]
Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets
Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss to the faithful fans who'd miss her

[Chorus]
And you can cage the songbird

Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed
You never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France

[Verse 2]
Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down
[Chorus 1]
And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone walls
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all

[Verse 3]
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner

[Chorus 2]
And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

[Bridge]
Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons
And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all

If I make it big, let me stay on top

I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life

They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you

I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear

He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence for someone like youEmbed"

The way you hold your guitar really gets me

Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City
""Hey man, how's about a handout
All you dudes just loaded down
Just a little sugar man, makes me sweeter
I like to sit at home and watch the world go 'round.""

Stage door monkey's on my back

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City

Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show

197,Simple Life,"Simple Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

[Chorus]
And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again
[Verse 2]
When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop

[Chorus][x4]
And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life againEmbed"

199,Street Kids,"Street Kids Lyrics[Verse 1]
They must've had the whole thing planned
There must have been a hundred
If we make a stand
I think we'll be outnumbered
If I'd had the chance
Then I could understand
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
In an east end gang

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive
[Chorus]
It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

[Verse 2]
I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted
Ooh, if we fight tonight
You can bet we'll all be busted
I'd like to break away
From the rut I'm in
But beggars can't be choosers
Yeah, and I was born to sin

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive

[Chorus]
It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids

I couldn't if I tried
Honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey, when you knock on my door
I gave you my key
Nobody knows it when I was down
I was your clown, nobody knows it
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us, babe
I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sightsEmbed"
201,Club at the End of the Street,"Club at the End of the Street Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand

There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

[Chorus 1]
That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Verse 2]
From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye

In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light

[Chorus 2]
That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
[Bridge]
There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord, have mercy
Ooh, you can't sit still
Oh, you can't sit still

[Saxophone solo: Vince Denham]

[Chorus 3]
Oh, that's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Hooh! Where we meet
Mean and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it, I thought I died last night
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds

[Pre-Chorus]
When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, he was so macho

[Chorus]
And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous
[Verse 2]
Well, I looked for support from the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray just to see if He would comprehend
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds

[Pre-Chorus]
When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, and it hurt so much

[Chorus]
And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous
Ya know, I think I really like...

203,Into the Old Man’s Shoes,"Into the Old Man’s Shoes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah, with the sun behind my back
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say
And all they say is, ""You ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family""
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
For I'm not that guy, or so it seems, to fill my old man's shoes

[Chorus]
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus/Fade out]
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I cannot see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
Oh, they'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I cannot see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord

You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock, but before high noon
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You've got one life with a reason
You need two hearts on one side
When you stand alone and there's no one there
To share the way it feels inside and baby

You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
When you're gonna play with fire
You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there
To cool the flames beneath your feet and baby

You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone

I know that I need you more than I did before

I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no

If you could see the state I'm in you'd never know
That it was the same old me that told you to go
I've never been happy since I walked out on you

You know that I've missed you more than anything at all
If there's any way to get you back I'll try it
I won't deny it, I'm lonely for you girlEmbed"

Torn from their families
Mothers go hungry
To feed their children
But children go hungry
There's so many big men
They're out making millions
When poverty's profits
Just blame the children

[Chorus]
If there's a God in heaven
What's he waiting for?
If he can't hear the children
Then he must see the war
But it seems to me
That he leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land
[Verse 2]
Dying for causes
They don't understand
We've been taking their futures
Right out of their hands
They need the handouts
To hold back the tears
There's so many crying
But so few that hear

If there's a God in heaven
Well, what's he waiting for?Embed"

Tune in, wouldn't it be something

Someone sent you something satanic
I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune
I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go

Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth
It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light

'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do

Long haired ladies well they look so fine
Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine

Oh, he was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him to the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I want to watch them

[Chorus]
Because the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before
[Verse 2]
He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized
In the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend that it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share
Alright

[Chorus]
Because the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded beforeEmbed"

Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
A radio humming in every car
And it feel like the clocks have stopped
Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was

Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'll say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Heart's on fire just one last time
A wishbone snapping in every hand

Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love

We found the place to feel it
We knew where we were at
Started the path, felt out our future

Sunlight shining on the morning tide
Got my ticket in my hand
Got some celebrating planned

Can't remember when I felt so fine
I've been waiting such a long long time
Just to hear those engines hum
Look out dreamboat here I come

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard, make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

If you love me like you did before
Be there waiting on the distant shore
When my steamboat comes inside
Then I know we'll be alright
And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Feels so good to know that soon I'll see
You've been saving all your love for me
For honey if there's any doubt
Just be sure I don't find out

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
Save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

Tell the captain not to take too long
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong
Fires are burning down below
Come on steamboat don't be slow

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Wind the springs, set the course
Pull some strings before I turn to force

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard and make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
Save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

You're my dreamboat, yes you are

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born

216,One More Arrow,"One More Arrow Lyrics[Verse 1]
He said I want to grow up
And look like Robert Mitchum
And I hope that when I'm gone
There'll be some say that I miss him
He must have been romantic
He must have sensed adventure
And I feel the steel of his strong will
In the frame around his picture

[Chorus]
And he's one more arrow flying through the air
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere
Where the days and nights blend into one
And he can always feel the sun
Through the soft brown earth that holds him
Forever always young
[Verse 2]
He could have been a boxer
But the fight game seemed so dirty
We argued once he knocked me down
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me
Strictly from the old school
He was quiet about his pain
And if one in ten could be that brave
I would never hate again

[Chorus]

One more arrow [3x]
Forever always youngEmbed"

Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinkin' of the ways that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreamin' of the open
Waiting for the day
But he can spread his wings
And fly away again
[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Let me wake up in the mornin' to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreamin' of the open
Waiting for the day
But he can spread his wings
And fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very, so very far behindEmbed"
218,Religion,"Religion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well he could almost taste the money
But he was sitting in a den of thieves
Looking for the great awakening
Trying to find a way to leave
But that's when he got religion
And the light went on inside
He said somebody up there likes me
Now he's working for the holy guide
He got drunk but he don't remember
That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
When he thought he heard a choir of angels
Singing in the Tiki Lounge
And that's when he got religion
From no salesman on TV
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
He still drinks but he does believe
[Chorus 1]
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

[Verse 2]
Well, she was silent as he paid her
But the thanks she got was next to none
And as her car pulled out of the motel
She felt the presence of someone

And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo (stereo)
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord

[Chorus 2]
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

We're gonna wind up with the man

219,Oceans Away,"Oceans Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide

[Verse 2]
Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away
[Verse 3]
They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion

[Verse 4]
Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

[Bridge]
Oceans away
Where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away
Oceans away
[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans awayEmbed"
220,Breaking Hearts (Ain’t What It Used To Be),"Breaking Hearts (Ain’t What It Used To Be) Lyrics[Verse 1]
They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals
I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile

[Chorus]
It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
[Verse 2]
And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone

221,Madman Across the Water (Original Version),"Madman Across the Water (Original Version) LyricsI can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You'd better get your coat dear
It looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black
Or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week
Can my mind really take it?

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the WaterEmbed"
222,Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part 2),"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part 2) Lyrics[Verse]
I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard

I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold
[Chorus]
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

[Chorus]
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

[Chorus]
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in meEmbed"
223,Love Builds A Garden,"Love Builds A Garden Lyrics[Verse 1]
You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say
Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face
A smile that spoke to me
In oh so many ways
The Sunday morning bells
Rang out that all was well
Sunshine across the yard
We’d rest when we worked hard
We take a little time off
To appreciate the day

[Chorus]
And love builds a garden
Grew it from the ground up
Each one of us knowing
Every inch of it was us
We pulled it all together
Hoping and believing
That love built this garden
For the two of us to dream in
[Verse 2]
We’d get a little rain
Then the sun came out again
But a frost it’s hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die
There’s only so much you can do
To keep some things alive

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sad to say, it’s true
Without a lover who
Cares as much
Well I guess, I guess it goes to prove

224,All Quiet on the Western Front,"All Quiet on the Western Front Lyrics[Verse 1]
All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

[Chorus]
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

[Verse 2]
So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands
[Chorus]
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

[Verse 3]
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

All quiet

All quiet on the Western FrontEmbed"

And pretending to believe them

And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end, Chloe

I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend, Chloe

Start to wear a little thin

226,Sleeping With the Past,"Sleeping With the Past Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
He's stolen your tears one by one
You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
You're a broken heart at the scene of the crime
And the night drags on, and the fever burns
Come to your senses, everybody learns
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
You're an empty doll in the power of a fool
[Chorus]
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between
[Verse 2]
If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back
[Chorus]
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between
[Verse 3]
But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
And he'll hurt you
And he'll run from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
[Chorus]
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream

That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through [x2]

Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through
[Verse 2]
So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill

[Chorus]
Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end
The lights go down on cue
I have wasted my time
But it tasted oh so fine
That my love still shines, shines on through
And my love still shines, shines on youEmbed"
228,Scarecrow,"Scarecrow LyricsYou're too low to see me smiling
When I'm flying in the air
But you're too high to frighten me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me

To frighten away all the lost and the lonely
The sacred forgotten of yesterday's problems
Your wooden construction was meant for infliction
To penetrate pain with the thoughts from my mind

Can you see me scarecrow
Can you still feel free
For all your love scarecrow
And will you still be there tomorrow
And will you still be there tomorrow
Like moths around a light bulb, your brain is still bleeding
From visions and pictures of nature's young raincoat
If only my eyes were not pinned to your table
My arms would be grasping the lilies of summer
It's no good to be a scarecrow post
And I've said it before, and I'll say it some moreEmbed"
229,Cold Highway,"Cold Highway LyricsYour life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground

Years rolling by just like a dream (ooh)
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone (ahh)
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone (ahh)

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to endEmbed"

If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might've been read on the planet Mars
'Cause I don't have foresight to see
If we'll still be together in the twenty-first
In the twenty-first century, oh no

[Verse 2]
He's our flyin' ace, Pilot of the Future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
'Cause I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny, oh no

I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye, restless night
You know I love Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight

Cold hand on my knee
Frozen teeth chitter, chatter
She's dressed up like a cemetery
Like a cemetery

Snowbound all winter
Blue lips on my cheek
Little tongues prattlin', rattlin'
Talkin' about them hometown geeks
Them hometown geeks

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'
I got a reason, and you got a feelin'
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Feels like a steam clean
When she washes me
Clouds a bustin', pumps a hissin'
Just peel me off the ceiling
Off the ceiling

Oh, chill out, bug-eyed-girl
Zap me into cinders
Pop the thermal mumbo jumbo
Melt me with your little fingers
With little fingers

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, oh, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'

232,Belfast,"Belfast Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes
Belfast

[Verse 2]
Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rocks and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place
Belfast
[Chorus]
And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

[Verse 3]
Who's to say
On whom heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try hard to recognise
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down
Belfast

[Chorus]
And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver face

233,The Flowers Will Never Die,"The Flowers Will Never Die LyricsI watch the raindrops falling on my window pane
All the bloomed forget-me-nots won't falter in the rain
Electric light bulbs cannot replace the sun
And picture postcards can't reveal all the things we've done

And the flowers will never ever die
And the flowers will never die
And autumn in the country cannot withhold the sky
And the flowers will never die

He spreads his cloudy blanket on a raging sea
And calms the cruel waves with the help of powers that be
The hours fly by, the clock ticks on maneuvering its hands
While the autumn leaves fall from the trees and return into the landEmbed"
234,Emily,"Emily Lyrics[Verse 1]
The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around

[Chorus]
And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down
[Verse 2]
Emily prays to a faded hero
In a little frame clutched to her gown
Hears the voice of promise in his memory
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
In a cage sits a gold canary
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
As a soul ascends abord the evening
Canary sings to an empty room

235,Just Like Belgium,"Just Like Belgium Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs

[Chorus]
But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium

[Verse 2]
Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance
[Chorus][x2]
But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
Just like Belgium

Oh, it's just like Belgium[x2]
Isn't that just like Belgium
Oh, it's just like Belgium
Isn't that just like BelgiumEmbed"
236,But Not for Me,"But Not for Me LyricsWritten by George and Ira Gershwin
From Four Weddings and a Funeral soundtrack

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot for meEmbed"
237,Love is a Cannibal,"Love is a Cannibal LyricsWe follow the dog who follows the cat
We swallow the chain if they don't fight back
We come and go, just getting by
We got a flag on the moon, we got a hole in the sky

And each man kills the things he loves
It's an edible romance we all dream of
And love eats love, eats love
Love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal
She have the hunger
But man is the animal
And love eats love, eats love
Love is a cannibal

We live in the woods but we hate the trees
We kill off the jungle but we save the leaves
The family face is painted greyEmbed"

It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

[Chorus x2]
Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen

[Chorus]
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

[Verse 2]
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn
[Chorus]
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies thereEmbed"

Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Going to miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

[Chorus]
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
[Verse 2]
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance

241,The Emperor’s New Clothes,"The Emperor’s New Clothes Lyrics[Verse 1]
We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus]
And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes
[Verse 2]
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes

We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

242,Can’t Stay Alone Tonight,"Can’t Stay Alone Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I blew the dust out of the corners
Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire
Should have called you up this morning
But I'm such a fool at times
I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine

[Chorus]
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
[Verse 2]
Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile
You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold

[Chorus]
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

[Verse 3]
Bruised in this cold war of words
We've come undone two loose ends alone
Possessed by that curse you've endured
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home
[Chorus]
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonightEmbed"
243,Sartorial Eloquence,"Sartorial Eloquence Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost of your own
You've got the knack of being so laid-back
It's like talking to the great Unknown
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
Pretty certain that you've got it made
Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade

[Chorus 1]
Sing it
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more
[Verse 2]
You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall
Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

[Chorus 2]
Don't you want to play this game no more
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

[Chorus 1]

Don't you want to play this game[x2]

244,Chameleon,"Chameleon Lyrics[Verse 1]
The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise
To see you very much alive in the English rain again

[Chorus 1]
And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

[Chorus 2]
Oh, chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me or am I going crazy?
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you're free again, my child
[Verse 2]
I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers

245,The Fox,"The Fox Lyrics[Verse 1]
Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do

[Chorus 1]
So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road

[Verse 2]
Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair
[Chorus 2]
And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Because I am the fox, like it or not

[Chorus 3]
I'm always going to be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox

[Verse 3]
It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire

[Chorus 4]
So I'll keep moving through the night
The hunter and the hunted
On their designated flights

[Chorus 2]

246,You’re So Static,"You’re So Static Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of the night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore
But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch'll do instead

[Chorus]
City living woman, you're so static
Matching your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie
[Verse 2]
Said you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
If they catch you, oh oh oh it could turn out bad
It's a show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time
She's a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying

247,White Lady White Powder,"White Lady White Powder Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dust settles on a thin cloud
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
Staring at a line of white powder
High-priced madness pays the tab
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder

[Chorus 1]
And she's a habit I can't handle
For a reason I can't say
I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say
[Chorus 2]
White powder, white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again

[Chorus 2]
White powder

White lady

You're one and the same
Come on down to my house, won't you?
And hit this boy again

[Verse 2]
Shock waves to a tired brain
Sends that hungry lady to my door again
She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain
Entertaining white powder
I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder

[Chorus 1]

248,Ego,"Ego LyricsTake a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly
'Cause I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right
I will amaze before the light I crave the light
Blinding white I need the light tonight

Take a look at me now and take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra, I'm in it for the killing
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
'Cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight
Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face

Well maybe it was childish, foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I had to grow and prove my ego

Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
Oh 'cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight

Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face

249,The Retreat,"The Retreat LyricsThey laid beneath the pine trees with their caps over their eyes
They were drunk with home and mama as they brushed away the flies
In an instant before the sunrise they had gunned the rebels down
As their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town
There were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach
There was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete
When the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in
Signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind

Take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

They just chalked it down in history but they kept their uniforms
They put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms
For it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best
That God had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest
On the plains above the rock face where the sculptured eagles swoop
There's a haunted yell for action among the spectres of his troops
It was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced
With the sound of retreating footfall from his military campEmbed"

Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
The bearded wierdy's just arrived

On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the roomEmbed"
251,Live Like Horses (Single Version),"Live Like Horses (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Elton John]
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
La promessa non fu chiara
S'erra solo impressa in me
Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
Quella notte dise a me
[Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
Vivrem comme cavalli
Liberi dai recinti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli

[Verse 2: Elton John]
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
Nel deserto la nave abbandonai
Per me aveva senso
Son stato troppo tempo nella bestia
Ed ora saro libero

Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

He died when the house was empty
When the maid had gone
He put a pen to paper for one final song
He wrote, ""oh babe, it's the only way
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living
To go on living
Living life this way""

[Chorus]
""And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're gonna take the news
But if I had my life again
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd let nobody, I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes""

""Oh
Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be

Like the dying flowers
And I've drunk myself sober
After hours and hours""

253,The Heart of Every Girl,"The Heart of Every Girl LyricsIn the heart of every girl
There's a woman waking up
Like sunlight spreads across the world
A smile for us is just enough
But in the heart of every girl
There's a homespun family dream
A light that's filled with so much joy
From a curly-head beauty to a teenage queen

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl
In the heart of every girl
There's always room for Valentines
And boys to kneel and tip their hands
With words as sweet as summer wine
And in the heart of every girl
There is a rose for every spring
A peach that's fragrant and divine
She shines just like a wedding ring

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl

Eyes can light up any room
The moment she steps in
Intoxicating everyone
A life alone should be a sin

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girlEmbed"

Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help

Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help

Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm

Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help

I wish tonight wasn't wednesday night
I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of july (yell help)
And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight (x2)
Well i met this woman down in new orleans
Lord she built just like a dream
Even wore stockings that had seams
And she was ugly
Now hell i don't mind women of her kind
I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
She built like a steamroller
Just the kind to mow you over anytime
Hey the moment might arrive

On bourbon street
Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
So i better yell help

255,One Horse Town,"One Horse Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
Because progress here, don't move with modern times
There's nothing to steal
So, there's not a great deal of crime

[Chorus 1]
It sure is hell living in a one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair, just picking a tune

[Chorus 2]
And they aren't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
But if you want to hear Susanna, then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night
[Verse 2]
Because it's no dice living in a one horse town
Laid back, as my old coon hound
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal cause there's simply nothing much around

Look at me twice with wildcat eyes
Promise me everything except a blue night
Shudder like ice in cut crystal glass
Melt in embraces of crazy eyed past
And whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
Tantamount to a lie with lingering breath
Walking fingers run, hungry scratches left
Dull chimes ringing like an empty voice
A distant smile framed, her lips are soft and moist
With whispers, whispers, whispering whispers
And whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone
With your whispers, whispers, whispering whispers[x2]Embed"

Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress

I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Some kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name

Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect

I've lied to lie with danger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

Where is the answer
Inside my house
And I sit by the window

Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

Says them skeetas bit me one too many times
Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river

Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change

As the waters freeze up with the summer's end

Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friendsEmbed"

She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother
And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection

[Chorus x2]
And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea
[Verse 2]
The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after
And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand

[Chorus x2]
And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be

What you done to me
I was thirty, I look like fifty
But I feel like sixty three

It's this illegal kind of loving
That keeps my motor running
From the start to the finish line
It's a trashy kind of me that likes to believe
That I'm still trying, I'm still trying

That's a dirty and a low-down trick
My folks all think you're mean

But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always set those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from

You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again
It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon
I was joking with those things I said
I couldn't have been thinking
If you don't come back I think I'll crack
Just like my old ceilingEmbed"

Have you seen the North
That cold grey place
Don't want its shadow anymore
On my face
A man grows bitter
We're a bitter race
Some of us never get to see
A better place
In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south
[Chorus 1]
The North was my mother
But I no longer need her
You trade your roots and your dust
For a face in the river

[Chorus 2]
And a driven rain that washes you
To a different shore
There's a North in us all
But my North can't hold me anymore

""Say that boy's a wonderment""
""No! The kid's a freak""
But that kid he don't care none
His black hands resting on the keys
Hopping like a big old frog
And hissing like a train
Entertaining royalty
All points east, west and in-between
General he's a fine old man
Treat him like his own
""Boy wouldn't know from money""
Just throw old Blind Tom a bone
From the times of King Cotton
May we present to you
All you Jim Crow monkeys
From Harlan County down to Tuscaloo
Pay me anything you like
I'll pay it back to you
Be careful what you call me though
Some things cut clear on through
I may be an idiot
I may be a savant
I didn't choose this life for me
But it's something that I want
Cocks that old big head aside
Grunts a word or two
Keeps them guessing every night
Is he really going to make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slaving
""I wouldn't want him in my yard""1Embed"

Well, she swept through the church
Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang ""Son of Heaven""
And the groom just walked on air

I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man

[Chorus 1]
She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said ""I do"" like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

[Verse 2]
In the shadow of the holy
Oh, I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Oh, the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life

[Chorus 2]
She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name
[Instrumental bridge]
(Ooh-ah!)

[Chorus 2]
She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

Like a mystery
Like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
Oh! I'm in love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

(Ooh!)
Never knew her name
(Ooh!)
Never knew her name
(Ooh!)
I never knew her name
(Ooh!)Embed"
268,Return to Paradise,"Return to Paradise Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call

[Chorus]
Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise

[Verse 2]
The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart
[Chorus][x3]

[Outro]
I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise againEmbed"
269,Recover Your Soul,"Recover Your Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby you're missing something in the air
I got a name but it don't matter
What's going on? It's cold in here
You have a life but it's torn and tattered
Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark
Love was a fire but it stopped burning

[Chorus]
Spare your heart, save your soul
Don't drag your love across the coals
Find your feet and your fortune can be told
Release, relax, let go
And hey now let's recover your soul
[Verse 2]
Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
Alone at night in a losing battle
That perfect world is never clear
You have to fight for the things that matter

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Hey now let's recover
Hey now let's recover your soul
And hey now let's recover your soulEmbed"
270,Lady What’s Tomorrow,"Lady What’s Tomorrow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there
Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there

[Chorus]
Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough
[Verse 2]
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover

[Chorus]
Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will, we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough
Oh Lady, what's tomorrowEmbed"
271,Cry to Heaven,"Cry to Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night

[Chorus]
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
[Verse 2]
There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war

[Chorus]
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

[Outro]
Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to HeavenEmbed"
272,Tinderbox,"Tinderbox Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nostradamus said, ""I predict
That the world will end at half past six""
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

[Chorus]
We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox
[Verse 2]
Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June
The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are going to have to change
Some holes along the road get filled

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Pressure's going to cook us if we don't unlock it
Gun's going off if we don't uncock it
We've got to climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're going to burn, out on this beautiful rocket

[Chorus]Embed"
273,Long Way From Happiness,"Long Way From Happiness Lyrics[Verse]
I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose

[Chorus]
And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness
[Bridge]
I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind

274,Amazes Me,"Amazes Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me
Dixie shadowland
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony

[Chorus 1]
And it amazes me
Oh! It amazes me
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy
Is that big fat yellow moon
[Verse 2]
Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me
That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company
There is no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes meEmbed"
275,Look Ma No Hands,"Look Ma No Hands Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower
Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road

[Chorus 1]
The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma
[Chorus 2]
Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me

[Verse 2]
It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust
Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Aren't you proud of me1Embed"

What's your name?
My name is pain
Where do you live?
I live anyplace
Where were you born?
In the state of fear
How old are you?
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years

What's your plan?

When will you leave?
I'll never go away
How will you breathe?
You'll give me life
How will you see?
Sitting in the temple right between your eyes

Deny the passenger, who want to get on [x3]
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on

[Verse 1]
To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train

The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line1Embed"
278,Dear John,"Dear John Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got home today, took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine, she could not be found
All her things were gone, she just left a note
It don't take no mastermind to figure what she wrote

She said, ""Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me""

I don't want her back, I won't even try
This time isn't just au revoir, this time it's goodbye
We could not go on, living like we were
I was just about to write a 'Dear John' note to her

But it's best just to leave me be

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now

I'll sort it out somehow

So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Girl I can do without you

Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then I'd be finished for good
So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come, but my need is none
And I want to be alone with myself

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort meEmbed"

Do I have a shot at the big part

What a deal
To get a part like this

Little satellite
Brightest star tonight, oh my love

Do I have a shot at the big part

I can feel the time closing in
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
To cover the tears of this ageing game
But I can count on you to play your part
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand

[Chorus]
And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young again
[Verse 2]
I can watch the weeks sweeping by
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears
But I lost nothing when I gained you
You just blew me away with yesterday's news
When you run your fingers down my spine
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time

[Chorus]
And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young again

[Verse 3]
Ancient minds, ancient lives
Got a way of coming around
If I knew then what I know now
I'd make it back to you somehow

[Chorus]
And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young againEmbed"
282,Sails,"Sails Lyrics[Verse 1]
I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China
Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she'd guessed the number
Of bales in the back room

[Chorus x2]
While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails
[Verse 2]
Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I'm sure that it's warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy's sandwich

[Chorus]
While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sailsEmbed"
283,Answer In The Sky,"Answer In The Sky Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find
An answer in the sky
Well, they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky
[Chorus 1]
And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

An answer in the skyEmbed"
284,Michelle’s Song,"Michelle’s Song LyricsCast a pebble on the water
Watch the ripples gently spreading
Tiny daughter of the Camargue
We were meant to be together
We were made for one another
In a time it takes to grow up
If only we were old enough
Then they might leave us both alone

So take my hand in your hand
Say it's great to be alive
No one's going to find us
No matter how they try
No one's going to find us
It's wonderful so wild beneath the sky
Sleeping in the open
See the shadows softly moving
Take a train towards the southlands
Our time was never better
We shall pass the sights of splendor
On the door of a new life
It had to happen soon I guess
Whether it is wrong or it is right

We learned to be so graceful
Watching wild horses running
And from those agile angels
We knew the tide was turning
For we watched as on the skyway
The herons circled slowly
While we mere mortals watched them fly
Our sleepless eyes grew heavyEmbed"
285,Saint,"Saint Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no one's going to stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down

[Chorus]
And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me
My baby's a saint [2x]
[Verse 2]
I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witch's brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mystery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise

286,The Drover’s Ballad,"The Drover’s Ballad Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the sunburned plains of far-off North Australia
Came a fella born to ride the wide, brown land
Oh, he grew up runnin' wild
But soon, by all, was styled
As the country's greatest-ever drovin' man

[Verse 2]
Oh, his legend rode the winds from Broome to Darwin
They loved and loathed him right from end to end
For when the drover gave his heart
To a girl whose skin was dark
From that day on, he was no white man's friend

[Chorus]
So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, ""The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home""
[Verse 3]
Then they called him up to fight for Mother England
In a far-off war that spilled his brothers' blood
Inside the jaws of Hell
Where both his brothers fell
He just watched his faith in man die in the mud

[Verse 4]
There was no hero's welcome for The Drover
Just a country that had turned its back on him
When he came home from the war
His sick wife, they were not pure
They let her die for the colour of her skin

[Chorus]
So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, ""The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home""

[Verse 5]
The Drover is a man of constant shadows
Haunted by his pain, his past, and name
For every mile he rides
What he cannot hide
Is the longing in his heart to love again
[Chorus]
So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, ""The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home""

Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home
His homeEmbed"

There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways
Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows
[Chorus][x3]
And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway trainEmbed"
288,On Dark Street,"On Dark Street Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
Is this the best that we could do
I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
What did I ever have to prove
Because it feels like electricity hitting an open field
When am I ever going to to learn
Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel

[Chorus]
Oh and we must have got lost
Living on Dark Street
Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on Dark Street
[Verse 2]
All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
I pay the price for living everyday
Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
What'll it take to make you stay
But I've dreamed about an island
And all I got's a bucket of sand
I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
Now I get to see my family slipping through my hands

I wanted you
And I'm cold

Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep

290,16th Century Man,"16th Century Man LyricsOh it's great to see our homeland
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
We see what no sailor can
We are in the ball, discerning
We're antediluvian
Sixteenth century man
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man
There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
Things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort

There's no goldmine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never let them board
All in all the point we've made is
We don't want to go abroad
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century manEmbed"

I've lost and seen the world shut down, it's a dark lesson no-one knows

(Chorus)
And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Well I'm out of control, and out of my head
I'm tearing like a demon in no-man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train
(Solo)

Oh-oh
Mmmmm-mmm

And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Well I'm out of control, and out of my head
I'm tearing like a demon in no-man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train

And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway trainEmbed"
292,In the Name of You,"In the Name of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got a penny in my pocket
And a dollar in my hand
But I'll drop it in your tin cup
Cause you were a one man band
If I could make a million
On some TV show
On the roulette wheel
In a great big casino

[Chorus]
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I got my favorite hat
With that snakeskin band
When you need a little shake
I've put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely dive
To find the oldest oyster
With the biggest pearl inside

[Chorus]
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

[Bridge]
I'd claim a country
I'd claim a tune
All the undiscovered territory
Out there beyond the moon

[Chorus]
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you

In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
Oh yeah
Oh yeahEmbed"
293,I’ve Got 2 Wings,"I’ve Got 2 Wings Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I've got two wings to fly
They may be made of paper
They may never reach the sky
But I believe in mercy
I believe that man is good
And if they want two wings like me
There's a chance they could

[Verse 2]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I was born in Cedar Grove
That's in Louisiana
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
I found the calling early
Gave birth to righteous words
And in a tent around the South
I took my sonic church
[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

[Verse 3]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I take all as they are
I was the first man of the cloth
To blacken a guitar
Love was my redeemer
I felt it from the start
The Holy Ghost was channeled
Through the sound of my guitar

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last
[Verse 4]
Been a long time in the ground
Unmarked is my grave
But I reside elsewhere these days
Thanks to souls I've saved
I traveled far, I traveled wide
Three quarts for the Lord
Till one day he called me home
To claim his great reward

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at lastEmbed"
294,Hey Papa Legba,"Hey Papa Legba LyricsMusic by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1982

He would recount the stories he had learned so well
Fourteen years is a long time in one cell
When the pipe is passed the opium does its rounds
Papa legba sitting pretty in a chicken little town

His textured skin, like leather in the sun
Fingers beating hard upon a native drum
He picks his teeth with a splintered back rib bone
Papa legba bears his fangs and lays alone

Hey papa legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Hey papa legba, no one gonna bother you
Hey papa legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Shake papa legba, no one's gonna bother you tonight, alright
He was free to dance alone where the spirits run
His almond eyes would twinkle on a hundred sons
His champagne toast and white meat on a spit
Papa legba's drunken with a smile upon his lipsEmbed"
295,Big Dipper,"Big Dipper LyricsNow I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more
Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipperEmbed"
296,Just Like Strange Rain,"Just Like Strange Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away

[Pre-Chorus] [x2]
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

[Chorus]
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
[Verse 2]
Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain

[Pre-Chorus] [x2]
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

[Pre-Chorus] [x2]
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain

297,Stinker,"Stinker Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say what you will but I'm a stinker
I come crawling up out of my hole
Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
I'm a perfect curse to pest control
Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
Crawling around the earth
Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
I hibernate in English turf

[Chorus]
Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burning vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave honey
Tell me what you hound dogs think
[Verse 2]
Set in my styles with a beady eye
I got connections with the underground
Call me a common rodent boy
Sitting here safe and sound

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some mole hill mother sauntered by
Acting like the ace of spades
Don't give that cutey no reason to shoot me
When I'm living on the eggs she laid

298,Born to Boogie,"Born to Boogie Lyrics[WILKINSON]
We weren't born to stand still
Ain't a question of will
Gotta move it's a fact
You were born to react
You weren't made to behave
Like you will in the grave

Where mu-sic is played
Oh the soul - will be swayed
And your feet they will move
As if on - ly to prove
That it was –n't by chance
We were des - tined to dance

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle
Cos we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation
Come on and shake per bootie
Cos we were born to boogie
Anyone can get it
Cos we're born kinetic
Come on and Mash Potat-a
The way God made pa
Your feet and your hands
Oh your toes and your glands
Your eyes and your chin
Your face and your skin
Oh your brawn and your brains
Your balls and your chains

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle
Coo we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation

Come on and shake yer bonnie
We were born to boogie
Anyone can get it
We were born kinetic

Come on and “Mash Potat-a”
The way God made ya

We were born to boogie
We're all born to
We came up from the ocean
In full locomotion
And when we hit the ground
We just danced around
Because they say
It's in the DNA

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie

299,Postcards From Richard Nixon,"Postcards From Richard Nixon LyricsWe heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back
And I guess we’ll have to stay

In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We’re finally on our way

And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were “Where it’s at”
Or so the papers say

And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we’d never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson’s promised land
Where Disney’s God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay

And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”

In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he’s just about the coolest guy I’ve ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it’s going to be
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline

Oh, We heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “I’ve gotta go but you can stay”
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “I’ve gotta go but you can stay”Embed"
300,Between Seventeen and Twenty,"Between Seventeen and Twenty Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

[Chorus 1]
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

[Chorus 2]
So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay
[Verse 2]
And if I shower around 3 a.m
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray

[Chorus 2]

Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh
So much has flown between the years

Going to the chapel
And we're gonna get married

We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely any moreEmbed"
302,The Scaffold,"The Scaffold Lyrics[Verse 1]
In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun
[Chorus] [x2]
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

[Verse 2]
The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn
In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer

[Pre-Chorus]
Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun

[Chorus] [x2]
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, ""Good day"" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 2]
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye
[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see, yeah, what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 3]
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see, yeah, what's real
Tell me, grey seal

How does it feel?
Tell me, grey seal
How does it feel?

Check It out, check it out, check it out

[Verse 2]
And when I'm dead who'll fly the white bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
Because billy bones just wants to know who'll fly the white bird home

On a bench, on the beach just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you, plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean
Before light shook the sky, down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand, it's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away from hungry hands, from hungry hands

[Chorus]
Crazy water takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh, we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water

Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray for the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me, ooh, separating you and me

Because our love's all worn out
You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years

In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess

I am not going to die, I am not going to cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave

I am not going to fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave

And I'm going to do alright

She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh well the choice is hers

[Chorus]
Because you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you
[Verse 2]
Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home

How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men

How I've struggled for my money, sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey, Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while

All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

I never seem to look at you, and see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long, let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While i persist i'm putting out the fire

All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
Because you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl

And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me

There's a light on in your window
There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
The shadow knows that shadow's me
I won't crawl I caused you trouble
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling
Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes

311,Gulliver,"Gulliver LyricsGulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen

There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawnEmbed"
312,Shoulder Holster,"Shoulder Holster Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now, it was just like Frankie and Johnny
And it was just like Stagger Lee
Dolly Summers was a simple girl
From a mid-west family
With a stucco home and her own Mustang
And a charge account at sears
She had everything that a girl could want
To live happy for the rest of her years
But the thing that she wanted most of all
Was the thing that she had lost
To the arms of a downtown black jack hustler
By the name of Candy floss
They'd slipped town on a late night train
Heading for the west
Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her mustang
With a piece between her breast
[Chorus]
She put a pistol in her shoulder holster
She took her car up from Santa Fe
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes
Now she's hunting down a runaway
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor
You may be sorry when his light goes out
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster
You can never, never tell if the Law's about

[Verse 5]
If it seemed just like a movie
Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across the country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
An venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park
But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well, she quietly dumped pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone
[Chorus]

[Outro]
You can never, never tell if the Law's about [x8]Embed"
313,Fat Boys and Ugly Girls,"Fat Boys and Ugly Girls LyricsFat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart

And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

Fat boys and ugly girlsEmbed"
314,The New Fever Waltz,"The New Fever Waltz Lyrics[Verse 1]
Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

[Verse 2]
Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

[Chorus]
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
[Verse 3]
Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

[Verse 4]
Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

[Chorus]

And the dancers danced on throughEmbed"
315,Birds,"Birds Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong

[Chorus]
How come birds
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide
[Verse 2]
These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark
And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you

316,All That I’m Allowed (I’m Thankful),"All That I’m Allowed (I’m Thankful) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones

[Chorus]
And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed
[Verse 2]
Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach somewhere beyond this room
I always hoped that i'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]]
I always try to make things clear
Then I watched as progress starts
I only hope I'm standing here
When heaven finally comes to call1Embed"
317,Some Other World,"Some Other World LyricsYou stare through a tunnel of
Solid wall that should be broken down
And you can't see the field of green
Has been turned into a raging battleground
And you'll live with the consequence
Tell me why don't you understand
You'll destroy all the love that's been created
Be a miser with an empty hand
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world

If you hurry you can ride it back
'Cause once the bait hits the water
It don't take long 'till the sharks attack
Oh but it's all such a simple thing
Change is everything
Let me be the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live

I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world, in some other world
Oh you don't live in some other world, in some other world
Got to stop living in some other world
Let me help you with a change of mind
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you

Oh no I don't want it
You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall
Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain

Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us

Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime
I never say more than I need
The mystery runs deep
The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep

You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us

Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board

You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

Took the grand prize you and your eyes
Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

[Chorus]
Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond
[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love

Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind

Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart

It isn't easy to put it back again
It isn't going to be easy to forget
Now you've been seeing a man that I am not met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You got to play your cards or fold a losing hand

Even if you can't dance at all

All you really gotta do is shine

It doesn't matter if your life's a mess
The whole process will coalesce
Just try to evervesce
All you really gotta do is shine

Everyone is different
Its a natural state
Its a fact

The world's grey enough
Without making it worse
We need individuality

With expressing yourself?
What we need is in-di-vid-u-a-li-tyEmbed"

Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when its sinking
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King

[Chorus]
For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season, erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tea leaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind

And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed

Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of a day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing
Daughters of some different ageEmbed"
326,The Wasteland,"The Wasteland Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some days I think it's all a dream
The things I've done, the places that I've been
This life of mine seemed surreal at times
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind
Could it be I'm not for real?
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved

[Chorus]
Come on Robert Johnson
Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart
You sold your soul at the crossroads
Kept a little of mine on hand
I'm wading out this muddy water
Been stranded in the Wasteland

Rattling chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone

Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
Because I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me

It all seems so long ago, I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream, I saw the red light flashing, flashing

They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me that I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains

Oh we've got to free our brothers from their shackles if we can, if we can

Most nights I have to watch my woman cry, won't you cry
Every day I watch the colonel smile, oh he smiles
His painted ladies riding in from town, in from town

331,Screw You,"Screw You LyricsWhen I was a boy I had a lot of fun
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life

They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you

I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear

He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence for someone like youEmbed"

When we lie on the shore

But my lips just don't burn
I feel so insecure
When you try to be kind
Could I ask for more

Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
Behind me
There ain't no easy way
To learn how to fly
I hope that I can kill
When I turn around you're there
Should I ask for more

I feel like sugar on the floorEmbed"

I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven
How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women
And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
Of understanding women

There's a porch swing in tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-your-mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old natchez trace
Through alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
It's a crisp golden autumn
On the tennessee line
Rolling down to mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth

[Chorus]
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in tupelo
I got nothing to do except hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in tupelo

His mama must have loved him
That truck driving boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock and roll voice
Well i was just thinking about him
Because I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to god through poverty's tears

336,Blues Never Fade Away,"Blues Never Fade Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The hows and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives
She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl isn't that enough
To rage against the day
[Chorus]
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

[Verse 2]
He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the sun king that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons i never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away

And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh

When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still isn't quite enough

[Chorus]
Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest

I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands

Help me information
Get emotion on the line
This war that's raging in my heart's
Getting harder all the time
Our painted smiles are cracking
Our worried friends just frown
We got a runaway train on an empty track
That's trying to run us down
And I'm a stone's throw from hurting
Everything we put together
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
A stone's throw from hurting
And I know it's never going to get no better
Crippled conversation hangs inside this house
Our voices just get ugly
When our love gets all talked out
Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry
Our touches don't connect
We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy
That our idle fingers wrecked
[Chorus][x2]
Some things get broken

Some things get better

339,Man,"Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man
[Verse 2]
Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

[Bridge]
He's the hoax
Behind the thrill
The poison arrow
The bitter pill
Hard to swallow
Hard to kill
Hard to understand
He's the light
Behind the hill
The broken promise
The iron will
Hard to kill
Hard to understand
[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

Have a little faith in manEmbed"
340,My Quicksand,"My Quicksand Lyrics[Verse 1]
I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand
[Verse 2]
I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

[Verse 3]
I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand
My quicksand
[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

341,Sweat It Out,"Sweat It Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season
Dictate to my reason
She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason
Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke
[Chorus]
Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out

[Verse 2]
Hope froze in the cold weather
No ice on a greasy river
Liberty and John Doe
Stand and Shiver
War waits when the lines form
The baby sitter in a uniform
Knocking down your door
For your rice and corn

342,The Open Chord,"The Open Chord Lyrics[Verse 1]
You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town

[Chorus]
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
[Verse 2]
You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound

[Chorus]
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

[Verse 3]
Sat around and waited for a spark
And it brightened up the night
Before I get much older
I want the pleasure of seeing you up in lights
I could then beside you
Hand over my heart and say a prayer
Love's not for quitters
It's a satisfaction
Knowing that you're there
[Chorus]
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them

And all this science I don't understand

344,Voyeur,"Voyeur Lyrics[Verse]
I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

346,I Cry at Night,"I Cry at Night LyricsThis house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason

Then someone shot through the tyre swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season

And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's tought to survive
This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to Rock And Roll
But he has to tremble

For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathingEmbed"
347,And The House Fell Down,"And The House Fell Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town
Oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down
[Verse 2]
With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer because I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell downEmbed"
348,House of Cards,"House of Cards LyricsI hear tell some playboy has kidnapped your heart
With his plane and his plans for games after dark
Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room
Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume

If there's sharks in the water, don't swim where it's deep
For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet
It could be alright that I act like a child
But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild

You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high
What will you do when the chips start to fly
When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard
Oh it's four walls of madness in this house of cards

Common you call me, but I know there's time
In a handful of diamonds, a heart's hard to find
And your house of cards starts weighing you down
Your nights become restless when the clubs start to poundEmbed"

Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind the counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon

[Chorus 1]
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up

[Verse 2]
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door
[Chorus 2]
In neon[x2]

Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon

You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free

I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky

Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

[Verse 2]
Can't always agree on all my dumb ideas
I'm still looking for a way out of here
You can value what you want
But you pay for change
There's full moons, cold lifeless nights
And tumbled stars spell out your name

Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room

And it's always gonna lead you home

Close your eyes, take a ride
Think of everytime that you
Missed your opp
Click your heels, see how it feels
Something so childish
Sometimes seems so real

Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you

And it's always gonna lead you home

That things can only get better

Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B
And all that political crap

[Chorus]
Because I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff

If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through

One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around

When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that

Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight

There's a long list of names
That i don't recall

Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting

I'm amazed that I'm still around

On that hollow log

Tall tales down the river

Got a future filled with rain

Bug buzzing in an empty glass
Fiddle scratching some lazy tune

Swears the South's gonna rise again soon
All over the place

They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins
[Verse 2]
They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

[Verse 3]
We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on

And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear

Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space
Yeah they got competition now

But there hasn't been no looking back

Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan
Oh here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there haven't been no angels round
Since God invented girls

Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got
Just you and me at a crossroads then
Isn't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight
[Chorus 2]
In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone

[Verse 2]
In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer goneEmbed"
363,Latitude,"Latitude Lyrics[Verse 1]
Grey London morning
Wet London streets
Rain on the window
Wind in the trees
It's my time to write
It's your time to call
There's something about distance
That gets to us all

[Verse 2]
Dark clouds above me
Little people below
All walk with a purpose
With someplace to go
It's my place to paint
My own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas
It's just the weather and me
[Chorus]
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

[Verse 3]
Cracks in the sidewalks
Dogs on the run
An old poster reading
""Give us your sons""
Window frames capture
Moments in time
But latitude captures
The heart and the mind

[Chorus]
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude
[Chorus]
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

364,Give Me the Love,"Give Me the Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
I've been lying, and hanging you up, because
I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
I am the thunder, and you are my lightning
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart[x2]
Give me the love, give me the key to your heart
Months of watching, and hours of hoping
That you'd want me, when you see me again
For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
You got the power to fly me again
You've been trying to build walls all around you
But you're lying, because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
But you're chasing what you've never believed in
Months of watching
And hours of hoping
That you'd want me
When you see me again
For I am an eagle
But my wings are all tied up
You got the power
To fly me again
[Chorus][x2]
So, give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love
Give me the key to your heart

[Verse 2]
You've been trying
To build walls all around you
But you're lying
Because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying
To capture that feeling
But you're chasing
What you've never believed in

365,Too Young,"Too Young Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Your mother's eyes look straight through me
Whenever we meet
Your father swears it'll never be
As long as he breaths
And how many times have they told you
That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young

[Verse 1]
If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along
But we were always winners
And how many people, have told you
That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
Because you're too young
[Chorus 2]
Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young
We could try it for a while
But they'd get us in the long run
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young

I got to quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue
You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house
And it's no use each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe

[Chorus]
Up on Blue Avenue [x3]
[Verse 2]
Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around
Let them say what they want
You and me we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus babe
To save you from Blue AvenueEmbed"
367,Li’l ’Frigerator,"Li’l ’Frigerator Lyrics[Verse 1]
She looked so easy because she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side
Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Look a little closer, that's acid rain

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Why little frigerator you're so cold
Go little frigerator go
Get away from my soul
Little frigerator you're so cold
[Verse 2]
She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive breath
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
Just another statistic on her readout sheet

368,Breaking Down Barriers,"Breaking Down Barriers Lyrics[Verse]
I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out
I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine
I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You got to go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You got to give if you want to get
And I want all you gotEmbed"
369,Can I Put You On,"Can I Put You On Lyrics[Verse 1]
I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day
Like a blind street musician, I never see those who pay
It's dirty work in Birmingham, better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man

[Pre-Chorus]
And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

[Chorus]
Can I put you on? People, can I put you on?
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on
[Verse 2]
And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester but the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
And the van that comes around weekends selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat and the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

Can I put you on? People, can I put you on?
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

J'ai en moi la tempete de celui qui veut
J'ai en moi la vie, j'ai en moi le feu

J'ai la patience immence et le fil du passé
Et j'ai les mains tendues pour prendre et pour donnerEmbed"

Hand it over
Reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want
What you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine
Come on out
Cause you want to play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay

[Chorus]
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
[Verse 2]
I roamed around
Looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went
What I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you
I can't move so
Never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would

[Chorus]
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

Hold out, distilling down
What's it going to be
Never tell
In a million years
No, you can't get enough of me

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you

Or just some guilty pleasure

It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
Can't get no work, I can't get a job
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot
Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and
Buried

[Chorus]
And Everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless
[Verse 2]
Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger
Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger
The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching
They tell us that we're poisoned from everything that we're
Touching
Well we could be children from the way we're acting
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action
We just breed and we lose our nerve
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world

Take me back to the source

And let it run its course

Take me back to my childhood
When I was so alone
Let me feel like a child would
Looking out across the great unknown

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
Forget the tied up time and let my spirit free

Take away the illusion
Of the man, of the king
Help me lose the confusion
So I can breathe again
Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
So you can just be you and I can just be me1Embed"

And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
You read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe
The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

[Chorus]
And so they say ""The end will come for us""
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means

And so they say ""The end will come for us""
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must

It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar
Staring in their glasses
Looks like another layoff at the yard
Yesterday I heard union hall come down
They hit it with a wrecking ball
And they try but nothing changes in this town

[Chorus]
Cap in hand stood in line
Your family ties are the chains that bind
The endless wheel goes round and round
Chances are you'll never leave this town
Oh oh no

[Verse 2]
Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with rain
It's falling on the playground
While the kids get wet playing the same old games
Locked away so many things remind them of war
They tap the pavement with their canes
The good old days ain't so good no more

378,Legal Boys,"Legal Boys Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your accountant called this morning
There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today
Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two
[Chorus]
It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus
The legal boys have won again
And you and I have lost
They can't tell us how it happened
But they'll let us know the cost
Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
There's a lot I'd like to tell you
But I can't get past your guards
I do not speak their language
And they hold all the cards
I would rather call you darling
Than defendant in the case
But lovers left here long ago
And clients took their place

379,Two Rooms at the End of the World,"Two Rooms at the End of the World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line
But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world
Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried
[Chorus]
Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold

[Chorus][x2]
But where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

One of those men upon the screen
With an elegant lady and a cafe in Paris
Serving Pernot and Kalua with cream

You can see it I know
All the doors have been closed in my face
And the drinks at the Casbah
Run a mile or more from this place

And oh Jessie won't you look at the planes
Tell me, oh Jessie, is it true what they say
That there's a capital G in the name of the game
And the runway's a home for my silver-red plane

And won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jessie ain't those wings just fine
Don't it make you want to fly someday
Why friend am I so still
Tied to my job with time to kill
Do I still bear the traces of old Don Quixote
Tilting giants on imaginary hillsEmbed"

Hey there, Georgie
Got a couple of things to say
One, you're my friend, and two, it's hurting me
Seeing you act this way
But my hands are tied and I can only try
To talk you out of a fall
Because the reputation of the woman you're dating's
About as nasty as the Berlin wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
Oh, man, you've got to watch yourself
She's going to get in your head, she's going to crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else
[Chorus]
Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
She's just another divorcee
An undercover lover of a hundred other little fish in the sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You better cut her loose
Before she gets her hooks in you
If you gave her the world and it was covered in pearls
She'd only ask for the moon
She's got you hypnotised with her big brown eyes
And a body that could stop a clock
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
Georgie, boy, you're in for a shock

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, it isn't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down you'd do the same for me
It's always been that way
She's got you paralysed with a pack of lies
About honour and the single girl
And if you buy that line, you must be out of your mind
You must be living in another world

You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place

If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how I feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears
Just release me I can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb

It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back

Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding placeEmbed"

Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout ""Hey, I'm chasing the crown""

Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple

Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me
Hold Thou, thy cross, before my closen eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's, morning breaks, and earth's, vain shadows flee

You're holding back
You're hard to read

Built for speed

An architect
Of grand romance

Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

[Verse 2]
Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know
[Chorus]
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my LordEmbed"
388,Good Morning Freedom,"Good Morning Freedom Lyrics[Verse 1]
Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I got to get away from the busy man's phones

[Chorus]
Got to make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy, then people, come along with me
A fee, fa, fou, fa, fa, fa, fa, fouu

[Verse 2]
Run along boy, set a place for me
I'm getting so tired of the company
I'm getting [?] looks from the big white man
I got to get away just as fast as I can
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Good morning freedom, got to break away
Got to break away, got to break away
Good morning freedom, it's another day
It's another day, it's another day
Good morning freedom
A fee, fa, fou, fa, fa, fa, fa, fouu

A city tired living is the game to play
Loving thy neighbor is the real life thing
There's only one way to get the people to sing

389,Burning Buildings,"Burning Buildings Lyrics[Verse 1]
It used to be a sweet sensation
No price too high for love
Now I pay for this bitter taste
And the price is not enough
Such cruel sport for your kicks
Such hard knocks on my heart
How long before the pain ends
Tell me where living starts

[Chorus]
And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire
Lovers leap off burning buildings
Live our life on borrowed time
Every flame that ever moved you
Touched your lips but never mine
Lovers leap off burning buildings
[Verse 2]
No room for conversation
Cold stares and angry words
Fall in pieces from our faces
We read ""do not disturb""
Some lovers just go hungry
Others beg for just a bite
You use me under pressure
To whet your appetite

390,I Fall Apart,"I Fall Apart Lyrics[Verse]
Without you I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed
And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision
Hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely
When the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time
When I fall apart
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away
I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her I'll give her three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was meEmbed"

No more Valentine's Day
No more Christmas cards
I've thrown them all away
No more sequined stars
No birthday wishes
No more surprises
Who needs them anyway
No reason to get excited
Yes I gave you everything
I gave you earth and sky
And everything in between
That walks or crawls or flies
No Easter mornings
It's your cross now
Keep it all for yourself
It's overrated anyhow
[Chorus][x2]
But keep my Valentine
I'll keep my bleeding heart
Just let me out of here
Before that sentimental music starts
And your regrets
Fall like empty lines
Like the lies we write on ValentinesEmbed"

Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
I said honey, I said honey
I said honey, I said honey

All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please

Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out
Campus queen dreams shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows

It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song
Mama said to me, John you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf

I want to write a country love song, tell them nothing's wrong
Suzie did my heart
There is nothing more, something said before
C'est la vie, mon cherie
Lady Luck, me and sexy so-and-so
And I'm the one who knowsEmbed"

You were always pleasing
Till you tore us apart

How could you be so unkind
Then you traded love for lust
But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
Look out girl 'cause I'm gonna fix you

I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
Sneaking out on Sunday
You thought I didn't know
Well early morning Monday
Once more you didn't show
Alibis and selfish lies
Oh I've had my fill of them all
You can dry your crying eyes
I know you're faking, there's no mistaking
Look out girl your heart might be breakingEmbed"

I'm not the same as I used to be

Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck

But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
[Verse 2]
I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture, and i might grow a beard
There were times i was crazy couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price

And I've taken the pills
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
But I've no regrets and that being said
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old

There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls

[Chorus 1]
And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
Because she hates those Texas girls

Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand

It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow

I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight

[Chorus]
But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
New York city I'd really like to stay
New York city I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way
[Verse 2]
Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where joey gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right

And I can feel the magic
And read a million lips
And no matter what might happen
They'll never sink this ship

400,Act of War,"Act of War Lyrics[Verse 1]
This isn't no battle honey, this isn't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war
Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war

[Pre-Chorus]
We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war
[Chorus]
Give it all you've got because I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war
Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours haven't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war

[Verse 2]
Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's going to stay
I call it, I call it an act of war

401,Madness,"Madness Lyrics[Verse 1]
The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold gray light, someone sees a shadow
Run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done, they listen
To the final countdown begun, three, two, one
Madness, it's a kind of madness
That turns good men bad
And we're helpless, caught up
In the madness of a world gone mad
The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear, a hopeless cry for help
But no one is near enough to hear
As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives they try to fight the flame
But nothing survives of all those lives
[Chorus]
And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain

[Chorus]
And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart
And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul, madnessEmbed"

Because she's the wildest thing I've ever seen
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat

She just does that double act
She got babs and joan down pat
She got hips like mick, she's a rolling stone
Never seen a woman shake like that
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

[Chorus]

She's so fine that the water line
Don't separate hot and cold
She got stitched up bitchy by an old m.D
Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told

Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her

In the summertime when the weather is high

You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a draft
Go out and see what you can find
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-five
When the sun goes down, you can make it
Make it good and then they buy
We're not grey people, we're not dirty we're not mean
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy, Life's for living, yeah that's our philosophy

Da da da-da-da, yeah we're hap-happy

If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into townEmbed"
405,Did Anybody Sleep with Joan of Arc?,"Did Anybody Sleep with Joan of Arc? Lyrics[Verse 1: Elton John]
At seventeen, she became the queen of Orleans
A peasant child guided by a vivid dream
She was cool before they knew what cool became
She cut her hair and cross-dressed in a dangerous age
She set a trend, a natural look was all the rage
Imagine if they'd had merchandise and poster sales
This bride of God, bigger than Elvis in her day
She had it all until they burned it all away

[Chorus]
She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight?
Was she lonely after dark?
Did she pray for something more?
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc?
[Verse 2: Elton John]
She was small and more or less of common breed
But saint aside, no stranger to a woman's needs
No handsome knights, no random acts of chivalry
Her bed remained a simple place for her to sleep

[Chorus]
She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight?
Was she lonely after dark?
Did she pray for something more?
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc?

[Bridge: Elton John]
They burned her down for her belief
They burned her down for her faith
They gave her up into the flames
Proclaiming she'd seen heaven's face

She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight?
Was she lonely after dark?
Did she pray for something more?
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc?

They burned her down for her belief
They burned her down for her faith
They gave her up into the flames
Proclaiming she'd seen heaven's face

They burned her down for her faith
They gave her up into the flames
Proclaiming she'd seen heaven's face

After all these rough seas, left me reckless and abandoned

Break down the cold front, give me peace and understanding

Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder?
Will she still be the star and see me through?
Because I can't steer my heart clear of you

[Chorus]
No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history, from the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted, let me burn or bring me water

No I can't steer my heart clear of you

A soft outline all poised and a feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream
And close my eyes

And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

Don't send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream
Where pressure cracks and beauty
Comes undone

I've got a strong-willed someone to love me
Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight

In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time

(Because I'm)
I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
Where you are tonightEmbed"
410,Where Have All the Good Times Gone?,"Where Have All the Good Times Gone? Lyrics[Verse 1]
See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet
(Long enough to hold on)
Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings

[Chorus 1]
Oh won't somebody tell me
Tell me where have all the good times gone
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone
[Verse 2]
Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah we had a good time)
Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
They've gone away
Gone they've gone away [2x]
They've gone away

[Verse 3]
It's hard enough to lose the game
And sad to see it played again
What makes you happy for a while
Is gonna make you smile through the rain

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Won't you please tell me where have all the good times goneEmbed"
411,I Must Have Lost It On The Wind,"I Must Have Lost It On The Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure

[Chorus]
From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess i must have lost it on the wind
[Verse 2]
Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the windEmbed"

413,Leather Jackets,"Leather Jackets Lyrics[Verse]
Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life
And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day
We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk, don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name
And idolise twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more ridersEmbed"

Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the windowsill
And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home

[Chorus]
And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend, honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl

Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls

Heartache, heartache all over the world

He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head
There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash, it'll drive you crazy
'cause the cops invade your dreams

And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend, honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world

Have pity on me
Oh, it looks to me like the weekend means
There's heartache, heartache all over the world

416,Heavy Traffic,"Heavy Traffic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Montecedo
Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside

[Chorus]
Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic

Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P

417,Big Man in a Little Suit,"Big Man in a Little Suit Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been staying up nights
Thinking 'bout a long flight that could take me home
Or a slow train rolling
Or a big boat floating out there on that lonely ocean
I'm not the man I was
I guess the dark side lost and the sun broke through
I thought I knew it all
I was the next big thing until I thought about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I was reaching for the stars
When I wasn't even touching you
I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
Thought I was living proof
[Chorus]
When there's one set of footsteps
No one's gonna fill your shoes
Now I'm looking in the mirror
At a big man in a little suit
I'm a big man in a little suit
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on your own
You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Oh, I was part of the chain
A face with no name in a place with no soul
By a thief in the night
I was robbed of the light and left with nothing, nothing to hold
I've turned my back on a world like that
I want to get back to loving you
Give me one more chance
Won't you warm the hands of this cold headed fool?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was reaching for the stars
When I wasn't even touching you
I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
Thought I was living proof

When there's one set of footsteps
No one's gonna fill your shoes
Now I'm looking in the mirror
At a big man in a little suit
I'm a big man in a little suit
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on your own
You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit

Just a nowhere man without a girl
Until that lucky day when she came my way
And she smiled at me as if to say

It's getting dark in here
Don't want to leave
Shadow's falling
And I believe
Winds picking up
Thing's so unclear
I'm afraid of my shadow
And it's getting dark in here
I'm scared of strangers
On the street
World's so ugly
I can't breath
Moon's so spooky
I'm close to tears
I've lost it all
And it's getting dark in here
[Chorus]
And the wait isn't worth what i'm getting
Sometimes i feel i'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And i'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here

[Verse 2]
Don't talk about angels
Or how i'll be saved
I'm no coward
But i'm not that brave
Rags are blowing
Rain's getting near
I'm done with running
And it's getting dark in here

Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in hereEmbed"
420,Old ’67,"Old ’67 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey how about this
A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights
Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on oxford street
Now we're sitting in the south of France
Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

[Chorus]
Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you
[Verse 2]
Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee wWlliams play
Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall
Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside

421,Je Veux De La Tendresse,"Je Veux De La Tendresse LyricsWritten by jean-paul dreau
Released as a b-side in 1983, and on the french album the fox

J'ai trop rêvé dans ma jeunesse
Aujourd'hui j'lance des s.o.s
Et j'fous ma bouteille à la mer
Je cherche amour beaucoup d'tendresse
Calins partout beaucoup d'caresse
Ciel toujours bleu bisous ça presse
Beaucoup d'beaux jours et plus d'hivers
S'abstenir si pas gentillesse

I dreamt too much in my youth

I'm sending out an s.o.s. today
And i throw my bottle into the sea

I'm looking for love and a lot of tenderness

Sweet-talk reassurance from everywhere

I want an everblue sky and kisses right away

Many lovely days and many winters

Are not without gentleness

Tendresse tendresse
J'veux d'la tendresse
J'veux du ciel bleu toujours toujou
J'veux des enfants plein ma maison
Des guitares des rires des chansons
J'veus qu'on s'aime
J'veux plus qu'on me blesse

Tenderness, tenderness

I want some tenderness

I want blue skies always and everyday
I want a house full of children

Guitars, laughter and songs

I want us to love each other

I no longer wish to be hurt

J'revois encore dans les nuages
Des grands bateaux des paysages
Des formes longues des grandes plages
C'était mon seul livre d'images
J'cachais mes rêves dans mon cartable
Entre mes livres et mes crayons
Des mots d'amour sur toutes les pages
J'ai pas grandi j'suis dans l'coton

I can still see in the clouds

The great ships, the landscapes

The long shapes, the big beaches

It was my only book of pictures

I hid my dreams in my briefcase
Between my books and my pencils

Words of love on every page

I did not grow up

I have always been kept from the world

Mais où sont-ils ceux que j'attends
Depuis qu'j'mange plus de sucre d'orge
Quelque part avec des enfants
C'est p't'être ça leur île au trésor
J'voudrais voler vers le soleil
Avec tous ceux que j'aime, qui m'aiment
Voler plus loin qu'le gris du ciel
Du côté où la vie est belle

But where are the ones i'm waiting for

Since the time i had barley sugar

Somewhere with the children

Maybe that is their treasure island

I want to fly towards the sun

With everyone i love and who love me

Fly beyond the grey sky

To a place where life is beautifulEmbed"
422,Johnny B. Goode,"Johnny B. Goode Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go
Go Johnny go go go[x4]
Go go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, how that little country boy could play
His mother told him, someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
And maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight

423,Just Like Noah’s Ark,"Just Like Noah’s Ark Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark
Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark
[Chorus]
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

[Verse 2]
These four walls have seen
The cockettes and the casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say

424,I Stop And I Breathe,"I Stop And I Breathe Lyrics[Verse 1]

We took it on the chin
But in the thirteenth hour

But we're strong enough
Like traffic all tied up
And when the static clears
The radios still buzz

[Chorus]
And I stop and I breathe
Because you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Because I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have
[Verse 2]
Like blood in a vein
We chased this one down
And in the darkest long night
We turned it all around
And it was coal-dusted snow
That covered the fields
But the corn it still grew
And the injury healed

425,Strangers,"Strangers LyricsTwo people caught on a string
A high-wire act above the center ring
While the audience is wondering
If we'll make it back

Two people up on a wire
Overhead and under fire
While the audience enquire
If it's just a knack

Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers
After all this time
We've made the long and the lonely climb
And now we've reached the part
Where we find we're strangers
We were strangers from the start
Two people caught in the tide
On the edge of love and pride
And both afraid to approach the side
And fall again

Two people playing the part
But which is life and which is art
And isn't it a little lateEmbed"

I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh, you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far, oh, shooting star
And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star
And when that moment comes at last
And you remember who you are

And if it's all the same maybe we should part

I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out

In a room on the second floor
That used to be owned by someone who's no one
But he don't live there anymore

Only Rebecca clasping her head in her knees
Trying to work out what it's about
And why someone had to leave

But dry up your tears
Stop counting the years
Don't worry what's coming
Forget all your fears

And the tide will turn for Rebecca
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
Her life will change
Her hopes rearrange
Into something that might really matter
She's all alone in a world of her own
With a key that fits her lonely world

When the leaves turn brown

And a big yellow sun in the winter

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle
In a big round room on the edge of the moon

In a race for the final hurdle

No need to worry when you dance alone

On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace

Somethings so young and pretty
Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast

And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right

I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves
Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms

There's a string of dangerous flowers
All around my bed
There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me deadEmbed"

Released as a uk b-side in 1981

At last i'm over losing you
I've cried so many tears it just ain't true
My eyes are red, my heart is blue
I can't get over getting over losing you

I can't turn back the hands of time
I've come so far, i have to see it through
The trouble is that i still find
I can't get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you
Except in the morning and then in the evening, again in the afternoon
I guess it's true, i'm over the worst
But living's the one thing that ain't rehearsed
But i know that's all behind me now
I'm learning how to live my life anew
And as soon as i discover how
Then i'll get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you, i roll with the punches
I'm taking it easy, i don't play hunches like i used to do
I'm over you now
Still tying to forget you but i don't know how

But at least i'm over losing you
There's only one thing left for me to do
Oh my eyes are red, my heart is blue
I draw the lone on you and me, forget how fine it used to be
And i'll get over getting over losing you

How have I come to this?
How did I slip and fall?
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all?

This should have been my time
It's over, it never began
Facing a world, for once not on my side
I simply turned and ran

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far
I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
Oh, it's flown just a little too far, yes

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
People have faith in me
I think I once did too
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives
I’ll see the bad times through

This should have been my time
It’s over, it never began
Facing a world, for once not on my side
I simply turn and ran

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late

[Elton John & Janet Jackson]
I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late
I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
Oh, ho, yet, I learned it a little too lateEmbed"
436,Sitting Doing Nothing,"Sitting Doing Nothing LyricsI'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
People tell me I'm just lazy
Weather or not it's true I don't know

So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
Many people that I've encountered
Say they wish that they were free

And I know that secretly
All those people would really like to be me

So even though they tell me I'm idle
Why should I do what they say
For they're in the same place all the time
But I'm only there for a day
So I'm just sitting doing nothingEmbed"
437,Love’s Got A Lot To Answer For,"Love’s Got A Lot To Answer For Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pull my coat around me
Feel the cold wind haunt me
Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free?

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

[Chorus]
Love's got a lot to answer for
Oh, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for
[Verse 2]
All I need is darkness
The best of all protection
Freedom's like the stars in the sky
Alone and cold and burning
Each one keeps it's distance
If only we were stars, you and I

439,January,"January Lyrics[Verse 1]
Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine
Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed

[Pre-Chorus]
Should have had a talk with God
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in Heaven all alone
[Chorus]
And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares

[Verse 2]
Must have kissed you until I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the mornin' light
Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard

Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me

443,Japanese Hands,"Japanese Hands Lyrics[Verse 1]
Outside I can hear the fireworks
Beyond the paper walls
Where the symbols painted black and white
Run together when the rain falls
And the wind chimes across Kyoto
Each time the earth moves
Was it the quake that shook me
Or was it something to do with you

[Chorus]
And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
And your almond eyes always shine
Sitting cool behind your painted fan
All the secrets of the east
Conceal the beauty and the beast
For tender is the man in her Japanese hands
[Verse 2]
Flesh on silk looks different
Than on a cotton sheet back home
Where no one wears their hair like yours
Beneath those oriental combs
And with your thirsty fingers
Running up and down my spine
You forget the western woman
When you're sleeping on Kyoto time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
To the distant sound of drums
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
As the dragons on the mainland
Wait to heat the sun

Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward
This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how

[Chorus]
Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyse
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line
Did he shoot her with a 45
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine
[Verse 2]
Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself

445,Regimental Sergeant Zippo,"Regimental Sergeant Zippo LyricsMusic by elton john
Never released

There's a picture in the nursery of a well known soldier man
And he wants to be like father when he grows up if he can
His eyes survey the floorboards with his soldiers around him
But fear not for the future, you will climb the highest mountain

So regimental sergeant zippo
Stand up to attention will you
Hear the bugle sounding in the morning call up rising
So your cowboy castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

Just a small boy in a small boy's world
And small boys do strange things
He likes to see the match sticks fly
And hear the cannons ring
For his eider down, his battle field
And in his dreams his fights are real
Until the field is won, aim, fire the gunsEmbed"
446,A Town Called Jubilee,"A Town Called Jubilee Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said ""I'm going to keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck""
The boy just whispered ""OK""
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog
Dull as a plough share rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show
For a dollar and a half
[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

[Verse 2]
That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
""Gone to California""
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that westbound stage

[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee
[Verse 3]
One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called JubileeEmbed"

Had some good times
Jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door

[Verse 2]
Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by
[Chorus]
And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America

It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America

And if I fall it's good to know

To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me

The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

461,Heels of the Wind,"Heels of the Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire

[Chorus 1]
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[Verse 2]
How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
[Verse 3]
You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You, you rather have the wealth of kings
Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind

[Chorus 2]
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
The fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind[x2]

[Chorus 2]
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[Outro]
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind[x3]
Well mama, just a kick away, just a kick away
Just a kick away from the heels of the windEmbed"
462,Love So Cold,"Love So Cold LyricsMusic by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1980

It looked a lot like the same old thing
I've seen so many times
She was aging fast like a bandit
Born to a life of crime
Meanwhile he held his crown and watched her fall
Just bouncing her around like a rubber ball

Through her washed up eyes she could see
That the ties on her prince were gone
He turned the radio off when they played
What he once had called their song
Well the crystal didn't clink but they drink up more
And when he stayed out late she knew what he stayed out for
Love's so cold when you're growing old and your looks are gone
Love's so cold when your hands don't dance where they once belonged
If he's heading down to the red light and the local bar
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart

Due to natural causes she became distorted and she tried to leave
But the winning team had an ace or two up a crooked sleeve
For he knew that her age wouldn't help her get along
And that's what made his hold on her so strongEmbed"
463,Natural Sinner,"Natural Sinner Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel too old to work
Too young to die
But I'll drink wine and whisky
I'll keep smoking 'till I die
I wear a suit of sadness
Made by experience
For I believe that in the end
Time will heal what men can't mend

[Chorus]
I'm a natural sinner
Born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto
Distrust everyone
I'm a natural sinner
Born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto
Distrust everyone
[Verse 2]
Big men with small minds
Now, they're not hard to find
Now they ain't got no good side
It plain greed that covers up what's inside
Now ride the confusion
Withhold your trust
Struck with your own hand
When, you think the cause is just

[Chorus][x5]Embed"
464,Blueberry Hill,"Blueberry Hill LyricsI found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill

465,Nice and Slow,"Nice and Slow LyricsWe can spend the night right
So honey turn out the lights
And do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

You can work on a charm
And tell the man in your arms
To do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry

You can do it, you can do it slow
You can do it slow, slow, slow
You can do it slow, slow
Do it nice and slow
You can turn on the heat
To keep a man on the streets
When you do it nice and slow
I like it when you do it nice and slow

You can work on a spell
And weave your magic so well
When you do it nice and slow
Come on and do it nice and slow

You can do it, you can do it I know
You can do it nice and slow
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it nice and slow, slow
I like it when you do it slow, slow

Come on and do it
Do it nice and slowEmbed"
466,Town of Plenty,"Town of Plenty Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll say it again this is not my city
I don't belong looking for a town of plenty
There weren't these thieves
We had some thing in common
Goals to achieve
We had some thing in common
In a town of plenty

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see it, this is not my writing
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty
[Chorus]
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty

I'll say it again, this is not my city
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives

467,A Dandelion Dies in the Wind,"A Dandelion Dies in the Wind LyricsSee my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

If you're quick enough to rise
With the sleep still in your eyes
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
I know that only you can help me now

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind
But a dandelion sighs
And it tries to tell the wind
That crying's not a bad thing
Worrying is a sin

If they sent a cloud from heaven
I would ride into the skies
To escape all of my troubles
And to cast away your lies

Purple rains have turn to gold
The clouds of yesterday
And a dandelion dies in the wind

I see my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the windEmbed"
468,Hour Glass,"Hour Glass LyricsI'm just sitting counting all the cobwebs
And wondering just when you'll come along
You said that you'd be here an hour ago
But an hour ago is hours ago from then

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hour glass slips on by

Light another cigarette, watch the burning glow
Catching spiders in my hand, and then I let them go
Imagine pictures on the wall, watch the insects where they crawl
They don't care about you and I've nothing to do

Maybe the bus didn't get there on time
Maybe the train doesn't run on that line for some reason
And she might not come
Because she doesn't want to see you again
No no no, that can't be true
And I've got nothing to doEmbed"
469,I’ve Been Loving You,"I’ve Been Loving You LyricsI didn't mean to hurt you
You know it's just my way
Those things that I said yesterday
Were things I shouldn't say
Although you're blue
Just one thing I want you to do
Just forget all those things
That I said about you

'Cause I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And if you go away
I just won't know what to do

Yes I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And you know in your heart
That I'll always worship you
I couldn't bear to see you go
Oh no no no no
So don't you feel sad
It's not the thing to do
Because I worry
If I know you're feeling blue
Please put your tears away
So nobody can see
'Cause the last thing I want
Is for you to cry over meEmbed"
470,Take This Dirty Water,"Take This Dirty Water Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spare the rod don't spare the fool
If you take the breaks you're given
You get to make the rules
Take a chance and make it fast
If you break some bones on landing
You know you're built to last

[Verse 2]
Fight the tide and find the shore
If the gift horse isn't smiling
Just learn to ride some more
Common sense is a rule of thumb
If the suckers throw a red flag
Blow them all to Kingdom Come

And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring
Purify the stream

Search out days that never end
If it's only for the chance
To feel just like a child again
Tell a lie that speaks the truth
If the heart becomes a prisoner
Your soul will turn you loose

I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

[Verse 1]
You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete

Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

In the middle of the night my heart stops
When I see you in the moonlight
I know why I'm in love

Peace will come I promise you
I wish you success in all you do
And when I think about the rest
I know why I'm in love

It's hard to find the kind of thing
You've searched for all your life
Someone bright and crazy
With a little soul inside

And looking at you fast asleep
I thank the stars above
And what more can I say
I've said it all in different ways
The bottom line, the simple facts are true
I know why I'm in love with you
I only hope you know I love you too

I kiss you and I melt inside
What you mean to me I can't describe
And if seeing is believing
You'd know why I'm in loveEmbed"

I count the days that we're apart
I sleep alone when you're away
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay
It's all the same, you never change
You come and go just like the rain
I pray each day that you are gone
This time it won't be so long

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy when we meet again
I'll play my part
And wrap you up inside my arms
Oh you gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling then I'll just pretend
Right from the start
You never left me on my own oh you gypsy heart
I pray each day that you are gone
This time oh it won't be so longEmbed"

When I see your face

On the permanent dream
Like the palm of my hand
On a tambourine

Dumb rocks filling up
My poor head
Did you just say
What I thought you said
First cat back here gets the cream
And bounce a little river
Of my tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

A curveball coming
That I didn't see
A flash flood washing
Out a dried up creek
A went in muddy
But I came out clean
Like a Baptist banging
On a tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

You're a spinning-round gypsy in the moonlight
Cymbals flashing in the firelight
I'm freefalling into a dream
My hidden heart banging
Like the tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
Roll and rattle

You got my head ringing like a tambourineEmbed"

I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you

If you want a partner, hold my hand
If you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
Baby I'm your man

If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you

If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
Baby I'm your man
The moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep

But a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
I'd fall at your feet

And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please
I'm your man

And if you gotta sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if yo want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you

If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand
Baby I'm your man
I'm your man
If you want a lover, I'm your man
If you want a boxer, I'm your man
If you want a doctor, I'm your man1Embed"

477,Hoop of Fire,"Hoop of Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire

[Chorus]
And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire [x2]

No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire [x2]

Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Now everybody bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live insideEmbed"

Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago

Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See them shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones

[Verse 3]
The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eye
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles

I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key
And said she's free

Like a cemetery

Snowbound all winter
Blue lips on my cheek
Little tongues prattlin', rattlin'
Talkin' about them hometown geeks

Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Feels like a steam clean
When she washes me
Clouds a bustin', pumps a hissin'
Just peel me off the ceiling
Off the ceiling

Oh, chill out, bug-eyed-girl
Zap me into cinders

Melt me with your little fingers
With little fingers

So nearly so contented but a careless word too far

I longed to love you better but I swear I don't know how
You could have been my future but I had to have it now
The things we love completely we are fated to destroy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

It's easy to be certain that another's heart will fall
Much harder to be certain of your own
It moves you, and inspires you then it drives you to the wall
And leaves you so excited but alone

487,The Messenger,"The Messenger LyricsEverything is settled, immovable and calm
Nothing that has plagued our lives can ever do us harm
Then the voices railed against us, then the path was steep
Now the sounds are softer, now the road is ended
In your arms, I'll sleep

Turn away from madness, burn the inner light
Pray for me as cheerfully as I slip into the night
Death is just a visitor watching for a while
Sullen and predictable, love is versatile

Everything is peaceful, and falling into place
I no longer feel the wounds suffered in the chase
Then we were at turns divided, then by turns oppressed
Now the pain is over, now we lie together
Gratefully at rest
Put aside the notion that the end is near
Stay with me eternally, the terrors disappear
Death is just a messenger in a poor disguise
Fooling no one, lost for words, love is in your eyes

Now we know as we are known, unimagined things
Death is just the messenger, love the truth it bringsEmbed"

That reads ""you're lovesick""

My weaknesses for you
I could have understood, I could have read your looks
I should have known better too

I've been holding out but it's time to shout
You know I'm lovesick
A helping hand for a dying man
Who says he's lovesick

I can't explain why I'll never change
This sickness deep inside

If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about the times to come
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

You've been crying
And there isn't no use denying
It was me
Who put you through this misery
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's going to change me
Baby, that's the way I am

Always been the same, yes I was born bad
Never gonna change cause I was born bad
Only me to blame cause I was born bad
Yes I was born bad
Always been my habit, I was born bad
Just can't seem to help it, I was born bad
Always going to happen, I was born bad
Because I was born bad
I mistreat you
And you know I always cheat you

And that's the it's always been
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't

Leave the sinking ships behind

Come on to rise and win

It's your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going

And I remember the girl that I knew
From Yellow River

The weather man he looks confused
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that do you
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door oh that's all I ever got
Chances are you'll reappear
Swim my way in a flood of tears
No place to hide your conscience so
You're a sinking ship with no place to goEmbed"
495,Tiny Dancer (UNKLEsounds edit),"Tiny Dancer (UNKLEsounds edit) LyricsBlue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day todayEmbed"
496,Too Many Tears,"Too Many Tears Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did you see the first man on the moon?
Have you seen the first light of day?
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way
Did you go to Dallas on that day?
Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt?
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in between

[Chorus]
And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Because too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
[Verse 2]
The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Some things die so other things might live

Boy, I must have been green
Boppin' in the country
Fishin' in a stream

Lookin' for an answer
Tryin' to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights
Honey, I was blind

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
Oh, from a bottle of wine
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies
Down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home
Well, they said I was a fool
They said, oh, believe in the Lord
Is the golden rule

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

They said stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Livin' in the city, boy
Is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no?
How can you stop when your feet say go?

You better get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
Oh, from a bottle of wine

I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
At least that's what the papers say

Coal mines closed down
Nobody's working underground today
More jails, peace for sale
Japanese still killing whales
Teen dreams
On two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say

Death just buys cheap thrills

500,Gauguin Gone Hollywood,"Gauguin Gone Hollywood LyricsHe talks a lot but never talks to anyone at all
He shakes his fists at busses and old posters on the walls
He knows someone who knew something about J.F.K
But his friends are just the shadows in the halls and alleyways
The rumbling frozen pipes whisper secrets in the night
In the coffee grounds, his fingers sketch a portrait of his wife
She knew the legal eagle when his wings swept through the stars
Before he shut the furnace down and sealed away his heart

[Chorus]
It's Gauguin gone Hollywood again
A sleeping giant inside a rabbit's skin
Tahitian doors beyond the painted veil
Another simple mind adrift
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again
The day lacks color, days are duller than a butter knife
Rusty water running through hands out of touch with life
A man of independent means, he'd have us all believe
A soul who throws his wings away before he goes to sleep
[Chorus]
If only for a moment, the dead weight were alive
An invitation for the flame to shine a light inside
Illuminating darkness, giving him release
Then someday in his trash can we'll find a masterpiece

[Chorus]
Like Gauguin going Hollywood againEmbed"
501,Angel Tree,"Angel Tree LyricsThe angel tree has grown so high
And its roots are planted deep
Never climb that willow
'Cause its trunk is awful steep
Yeah the trunk is awful steep

Seven miles south of the city
Way on a windy hill
The whistling branches of the angel tree
Are calm at the evening still

Magical ???
As the leaves are ???
And strange things happen to people
Who go on to the windy hill
??? down here
Had gone up to there
And rested underneath her bough
They slept long, what is wrong
They never woke up againEmbed"

Nothing looks as bad
After staying up all night
And the cruel words that cut you down
I never meant to write
And what came out as anger
Oh was a lack of self control
Billy won't you hold me
Once before you go

Clever lies keep coming
Some men never change
I'm a hand that's raised in anger
The blow that causes pain
But I just can't be trusted
With a bottle and a child
Billy it's no wonder
You say I've never tried

Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbyе
To Billy and the kids
Oh so leave mе now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids

505,Duet For One,"Duet For One Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind

[Chorus]
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

[Verse 2]
But you and I have come so far
With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one
I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn
[Chorus]
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

Baby turn to me

Don't listen to the people
Who spread lies about your name
I know it hurts
But baby I've had it too

I've learned to live with their abuse
I've learned to live with those who choose
To disregard my emptiness and lose me
Your laughter has died in the heat of the night
The people they pretend that company is bright
But brighter you'll wait by the phone that has died
Don't bury your hopes, there's nothing that's left for you to confide in

But you seem to be happy just for now to go on
Try to see through them baby, can't you see what is wrong
You're hurting yourself more that you'll ever knowEmbed"

But it can't seem to come to me
When I call your name

I read your letters but you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

I pretend I don't see reality

510,Conquer the Sun,"Conquer the Sun LyricsMusic by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1980

The night we met, we stood
Divided by defenses as old as time
But love has found a way
To bring me to your senses and you to mine

So we meet in the cloak of evening
And we try to go on believing
Two different worlds can still be one
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

The night we met, we knew
What love would soon be leading us to do
And so it goes, and now
When wanting turns to needing, i turn to you
And it's hard to go on deceiving
But we have to go on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

As i lie here and feel you breathing
It's not hard to keep on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sunEmbed"
511,Rope Around a Fool,"Rope Around a Fool LyricsI don't make the rules around here
A tear starts at the edge
It takes two hands to rip it
It takes a lot more than either one of us has said

But I come from indecision
A place you ain't never been
Living in the state of confusion
On a map that runs like the veins under your skin

We got Miss Communication kicking out the stool
We got mass determination making up the rules
But saving us is something that we can't do
And it's easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool

And love is just another means
By which we hang ourselves
It takes two to execute
One to leave with innocence and one to leave with guilt
But I just see no reality
Just shades drawn on remorse
We've whipped this beast beyond the limit
Staggered out of breath along this course

It's easier to lose a rope around a fool
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
A ring of your indifference thrown anywhere you choose
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a foolEmbed"
512,Saturday Sun,"Saturday Sun LyricsSaturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear, clear and blue
But Saturday sun, it came without warning
So no one knew what to do

And saturday sun brought people and places
That didn't see much in their day
And when I remember these people, these people and places
They were really, really too good in their way, in their way

And saturday sun won't come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through, through your brain
Just think about, think about people
In their season, season and times
Just returning again and again
So Sunday sat in Saturday sun
And wait for a day gone byEmbed"

If you go astray

You do just what you please

How many times
Have you gone before
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more
Never had to wait
Like I waited for you
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
When you're gone
The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to make me cry
To make me cry

So if you're gonna leave me
Never to come back
Break it to me gently
Or my world will crack
So be sure to let me know
That I'll never say
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next timeEmbed"

Trust me
Try rolling with the flow
Trust me
I've been there don't you know
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, you're naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me
Too many years your heart has wandered
Scared to make a final move
Too many nights those boys have squandered
You got nothing left to prove

Standing there in front of me, butt naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice

515,Watching the Planes Go By (Band Version),"Watching the Planes Go By (Band Version) LyricsLook up in the sky
There's a speck that's flying by
Red lights and I don't know why
Seems that I spend most of my time
Watching the planes go by

The windows open, the curtains blow
Round my room where the lights are low
I stand in darkness and watch the stars
Wondering just how far you are from me

I'm out here
You're somewhere
Somewhere out there
Too far from me
And I want it to be
Like it was when the summer was here
Instead of just sitting here
Watching the planes go by

The street lamp look lonely
I wonder, I wonder if it feels like me
With no one to love him
And no one to talk to
When she's out there moving
Without thinking 'bout me

Come back, baby, come back
Let me pray that one day
That those planes in the sky
Will be bringing you back home to me
Back to me
Oh, I feed you back home with meEmbed"

And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh

Missed your stamping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off
But please, Billy, know that I was always there
I was with you through everything

And please, Billy, know that I will always be
Proud to have known you
Proud that you were mine
Proud in everything
And you must promise me this, Billy
In everthing you do
Always be yourself, Billy
And you always will be true

Nobody left in the airport lounge
They cleaned the ashtrays
TV's just wound down

I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through my flight

[Verse 1]
But when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas
The left bank is crying
For colour to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber
When I get to Paris
You were the best of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth
Art has its price
It's so hard to hold on
To the ghost of your breed
It takes ambition
To call the colours you need

I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town

Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home
Oh, let them cotton balls get rotten

Every turn exotic, lavish
Prescious wonders numberless

All your blessings save goodbye

Put my trust in poorer places
Let the queen of cities be

523,Reminds Me of You,"Reminds Me of You LyricsTake every ray of sunshine from the sky
Let the rain fall, I don't care if the flowers die
The night lights can forget me
The stars will never glow
The days just seem so worthless
The hours, they come and go

Reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
The things we used to say
The things we used to do
All these happy hours are now just empty days
And I can't bear the strain to pass the time away
Reminds me of you

I see couples walking down the street
I watch them here
With tear filled eyes there's nothing left for me
For I just think about the times
That you and I were two
And still these things remind me of you
Oh they doEmbed"

That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Well you came in loving me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you

Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And then if you can rememberEmbed"
525,Go It Alone,"Go It Alone Lyrics[Verse]
It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived
If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece
And I'll go it alone
Call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick
Till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you
There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean
If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my graveEmbed"

534,And the Clock Goes Round,"And the Clock Goes Round LyricsI came down here just to waste some time
To get a little rest and to ease my mind
I didn't calculate it when I walked in the door
I only thought I'd stay for a minute or more

First I saw the lights on the ceiling dim
The stale perfume yeah, and the beer canteens
My first impression was to get outside
But then I saw you crying, crying by the fireside

The pendulum swings
Going to and fro
And the clock goes round
Says it's time to go
And the clock goes round
And the hours fly past
Slow down pendulum you're moving much too fast
Now it's gone kind of quiet but I seem to see
That the only people here in the room are you and me

When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago

And the gravel started giving away

In younger times, children climb
Up and down your walls
And a curse on the day the fates will sayEmbed"

And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside

That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sunEmbed"

On the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn
All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom
Only if you want it bad enough
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of loveEmbed"

Is it day or is it night

The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall

I didn't know that love could move me so

We're standing on a land mine

You look at the cold soup
I look at the grey wall
I see a red flag burning
Yeah, man we need a santa claus

Down on the homeless avenue
Down among the rocks and stones
The cradle falls but the buck stops here
Let's think about their hearts and bones

And we all need a medicine man
All need a medicine man
Don't we need a medicine man
His shake and his rattle and his helping hand
See the meat of a nation
On the back of a truck
I think we're waste in a dumpster
Hey sorry kid it's tough luck

She was adorable
And he was a good boy
They were inseparable
Yeah bitten by the cold war

Rags on the shapes of millions
Tears among the cuts and blows
The backbone snaps and the kids can't dance
Let's think about their hearts and bonesEmbed"

Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

Make no mistake
She appears like lightning in a bottle
I catch the spark
Oh she lights the dark
The knot's undone the ideas come
Like two hands on a throttle

There's a place of one way streets and doubt
No red lights ever change
We wind up with no exit out
Facts are facts and stumbling blocks delay the mind
That's when my muse arrivesEmbed"

554,Love of the Common People,"Love of the Common People Lyrics[Verse 1]
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do
Tears from your little sister
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by

Because she's living

[Chorus]
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's going to buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love her just as much as she can and she can
[Verse 2]
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm

You can live

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You can take them in stride, for family pride
You know that faith in your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And a [unverified] prayer making you strong
Where you belong

Where you can live
[Chorus][x2]Embed"

Released as a uk b-side in 1980

Steal away child into your dreams
Where nothing is ever the way that it seems
I gave you your life, you gave me your trust
I've no wish to hurt you but hurt you i must
Steal away child, turn down your light
Steal away into the night

Steal away child to the land of the lies
Where love lasts forever and hope never dies
Sit safe for a place peaceful and calm
Where no one and nothing can harm you

Steal away child, you'll be alright
Steal away into the night
Once more goodnight, one last goodbye
Trying hard not to show how i'm making what it's taking not to cry
Steal away child, sleeping so still
Our love is too precious for distance to kill
But when you awake, morning has come
I won't be the one you turn to
I'll do what i must before it gets light
I'll steal away into the night

Steal away child
Steal away into the nightEmbed"

559,I Swear I Heard the Night Talkin’,"I Swear I Heard the Night Talkin’ LyricsIn the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
I run out the front door into the center of the street
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet

I hear you after midnight from the inner city
As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

Well, this is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking
On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl, she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the park

This is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking

This is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, oh yeah, is listen to the night talking
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And I swear I heard the night talking
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I swear, I swear, I swear I heard the night talkingEmbed"

561,We All Fall In Love Sometime,"We All Fall In Love Sometime LyricsWise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes

And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smileEmbed"

Where it's at
Dada dum-da dadada dum-da
Where it's at

He's a man who knows most everything
Of anything at all
Tells a story of psychology
And his story never falls
He's a man who wears a portobello yellow bill-bob hat
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at

He's a man who draws illusions
And he carves them on a tree
Including all the love he found
He gives to you and me
And I don't even know his name
But I surely promise that
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at
Roaming around from place to place
He takes in all that he sees
He notices the good things that please him
He watches all the bad things that grieve him
But he loves everybody and he knows just where it's at

He was born of Gypsy parenthood
And he's always lived the land
And if people who would talk to him
Just cannot understand
But no matter what they say of him
They'll always tell you thatEmbed"

And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose
(like a light bulb)
And if you ever saw it
(saw it)
You would even say it glows
(like a flash light)
All of the other reindeer
(reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names
(like Pinochio)
They never let poor Rudolph
(Rudolph)
Play in any reindeer games
(like Monopoly)
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
(Ho Ho Ho)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
(loved him)
And they shouted out with glee

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn
Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Till there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me

To reassure and satisfy

'Cause I really need you (really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too

While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

The toughest role you ever played

And pain was the price you paid

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have loved you
But I was just a kid

More than just our Marilyn Monroe

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by

Light another cigarette, watch the burning glow
Catching spiders in my hand, and then I let them go
Imagine pictures on the wall, watch the insects where they crawl
They don't care about you and I've nothing to do

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by
Maybe the bus didn't get there on time
Maybe the train doesn't run on that line for some reason
And she might not come
Because she doesn't want to see you again
No no no, that can't be true

The dark cannot destroy

You may find if he's there
It eases your mind
And besides he's so kind

I've served upon this railroad for longer than i know
My father and his father did the same thing long ago
To keep the western union rolling down towards the sea
The benefits of this great line built for you and me

So rolling western union, you can roll on to the sea
Ten thousand miles of beatin' steel has made a man out of me
In every state i've driven home a rivet with my hands
Oh it's rolling western union rolling onward, onward through our land

It's friends of mine who died upon the building of this line
Irishmen and chinamen and some from the british isles
I've even seen the convicts come to work here for a while
Before the law caught up with them and sent them back to trial
I had a wife while on the job a hundred miles on back
She died in oklahoma and i laid her by the track
All that's left is a wooden cross upright on a mound
And every time the train rolls past, it rumbles in the groundEmbed"

Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile

Let me be your car for a while child
Shift me into gear and I'll be there
Fill me up with five star gasoline girl
I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere

Let me be your car, come on and drive me

I got bucket seats and two speed window cleaners
Just let me be your car, oh come on and ride
I can't dance, I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl

Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
I know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me

That you love somebody else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind

People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear

And you were made for me
You were made for me
You weren't born to be alone
And you were made for me

You were made for me
You were made for me
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
That you were made for me
If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to runEmbed"

On the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree

Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom
Only if you want it bad enough
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of loveEmbed"
584,Twentieth Century Blues,"Twentieth Century Blues LyricsTwentieth century blues are getting me down
Blues, escape those dreary twentieth century blues
Why, if there's a god in the sky, why shouldn't he grin
High above this dreary twentieth century din

In this strange illusion, chaos and confusion
People seem to lose their way
What is there to strive for, love or keep alive for
Say, Hey hey, call it a day

Blues, nothing to win or to lose, it's getting me down
Blues, escape those weary twentieth century blues

Why is it that civilized humanity can make this world so wrong
In this hurly-burly of insanity, our dreams cannot last long
We've reached a deadline, a press headline, every sorrowEmbed"
585,Tartan Coloured Lady,"Tartan Coloured Lady LyricsThe grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the Tartan Coloured Lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the Tartan Coloured Lady she is mine

People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my doesn't fit her anymore
And the Tartan Coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place an hour or so before
And the Tartan Coloured Lady lost her

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And they've taken all the dust bins from your door
Take yourself the Tartan Coloured Lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more
So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the Tartan Coloured Lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home till fourEmbed"
586,There Is Still a Little Love,"There Is Still a Little Love LyricsThere is still a little love left for me in your heart
Even though it seems to you that we are far apart
You can turn your eyes to other guys, ignore me on the street
But don't forget it's bound to show if we should ever meet

And there is still a little love left for me in your heart
You can use a little love to make a brand new start
For no matter how you try
You just cannot deny
There is still a little love in your heart

But you're far too proud to say what's on your mind
I can read you like a story book, do you think I'm blind
For every place I seem to be, you seem to be there too
Standing in the wings of love and waiting for your cueEmbed"
587,Day Is Done,"Day Is Done LyricsWhen the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you begun
When the day is done

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold
When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
Now the bird has flown

When the game's been fought
Newspaper blowing across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to to start anew
Now the party's through

When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
Day is done
When the day is doneEmbed"
588,Red,"Red LyricsI'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listenEmbed"

Go your sweet way

And here's to the next time
And here's to the next time

How many times
Have you gone before?
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more?

Just like I waited for you

The time drags by

Never to come back
Break it to me gently
Or my world will crack
So, be sure to let me know

590,Taking the Sun from My Eyes,"Taking the Sun from My Eyes LyricsDon't you worry where I'm going
I'll just go without you knowing
I won't come back to you again
I'll leave right now and catch the train

Don't you wait for me anymore
I loved you then and then I was sure
Our love was something at the start
You killed the sun and you broke my heart

Why oh why did you do it
I thought I'd never get through it
While you were telling me lies
You were taking the sun
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes
So just listen to me while I say
Forget all the love of those days
They're only empty and they're goneEmbed"
591,Rock Me When He’s Gone,"Rock Me When He’s Gone LyricsWarm the wine and give it to me one more time again
I'm just a rolling stone who needs a drop of rain
And to taste your honey, Mona is like licking on the sun
My truck's hid in the back yard so come here and give me some

Said lady, that's the way
You've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other
And we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady
Gotta rock me when he's gone

Break the bread in two and you can give me half
I've ridden hard and fast just to make you laugh
To make you laugh I've stood knee-deep in mud outside your door
Clutching in my hand a border rose from BaltimoreEmbed"
592,Velvet Fountain,"Velvet Fountain LyricsDo you believe in faeries
For the children's rhymes are in my mind
Seen through the colours of my eyes
A rainbow in the sky

With the flowers of seed
Taken by the beautiful people who have gone
Where have they gone
Where have they all gone

They're throwing coins in a velvet fountain
Wishing on stars and floating on air
Can somebody catch me if I stranger
And the mystery beleives me a velvet fountainEmbed"
593,Someone to Watch Over Me/Love Is Here to Stay,"Someone to Watch Over Me/Love Is Here to Stay LyricsThere's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although she may not the girl some men think of
As handsome to my heart
She carries the key

Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me

It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies, and in time may go

But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Our love is here to stayEmbed"

This is the news
One, two, three, four

The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the tartan coloured lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the tartan coloured lady she's mine

People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my clove-key doesn't fit her anymore
And the tartan coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place, an hour or so before
And the tartan coloured lady lost her dog
So if your crystal window isn't broken
And thеy've taken all the dustbins from your door
Takе yourself the tartan coloured lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more

So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the tartan coloured lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home 'til four
Oh just tell her, I won't be home no more

595,Home Again (Live from Capitol Studios),"Home Again (Live from Capitol Studios) LyricsI'm counting on a memory to get me out of here
I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I spent being someone else's friend
Just one more time, for old time's sake I'd like to go back home again
The world had seven wonders once upon a time

It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I'd say a men if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

Could have been a jailbreak and a spotlight hitting me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home againEmbed"

Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
IF you know the way to blue

Look though time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind
Can you now recall all that you have known
Will you never fall when the light has flown
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blueEmbed"
597,The New Fever Waltz (Live from Capitol Studios),"The New Fever Waltz (Live from Capitol Studios) LyricsForgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
And the dancers danced on throughEmbed"

She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

Oh, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here aloneEmbed"
599,The Hands Of Angels,"The Hands Of Angels LyricsWell, I could have been sick, I could have died
I could have given up and not tried
To make it to tomorrow
Like a broken hearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken
It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor
Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses
And they knew all the places I needed to go
All of the people I needed to know
They knew who I needed, who needed me
And who would come help me and who would just let me be
I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say?
When you're in the hands of angels
Life is, oh, so sweet
And you feel the love down deep inside
Even out there on the street
In the hands of angelsEmbed"
600,Your Song (Demo),"Your Song (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words

And watch the spectre of the night time
Read the sign killing time
And they can't see me, they can't see
Synthetic sounds around the town
Moaning bus queues all alone
Trying to find their own way home
Some are young and some are grown

There's still time for me
With just a little help from you

There's still time for me
There's still time for me

The mist of the city has soaken through my clothes
The people who were there before were only there to gloat
Synthetic sounds around the town
Moaning bus queues all alone
Trying to find their own way home
Some are young and some are grown
Get some bitches on yo dick or keep that yee yee ass haircutEmbed"
602,Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight) (Live from Capitol Studios),"Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight) (Live from Capitol Studios) LyricsI carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eyes
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yeaEmbed"

'Cause what I've got to say I only hope and pray
Comes out as well as I rehearsed it yesterday

And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go
And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go and leave her alone
With the broken dreams that she owns

It's a crime for me to tell you
It's a sin for me to stay
And I'll never look behind me
When I start to walk away
Firl I'm sorry but it's all that I can say
You know that I used to love you so
Enjoy every moment together
Well I'm not the kind of man
To forever hold your handEmbed"

Slumbering and spherical, you're always hanging around
Leather on the outside but a delicate interior
Very like a lot of human beings I have found

Hey armadillo I can't tell which way you're facing
Maybe that's a good thing, maybe you don't even know
No one's gonna bother you if they can't find your front end
There again I guess you find your love life rather slow

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo
Hey armadillo what you doing in the desert
Is a life of burrowing the answer to it all
What I would give to leave my problems six feet underground
And always be the perfect shape to be, and have, a ball

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo

My shoes are tilting over to an angle at the heel
I should be feeling sorry for myself and I may
But I've got a little happiness, I know she's gone away

Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To take away my suffering and pain
Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To show me that the good times will be here once again

She's got the face of an angel and a heart made of gold
She's got me feeling like a spy that came in from the cold
Now I can shout about it, that's the way that I feel
'Cause Sara's coming back to me, she's coming back for real

Now I know that I wasn't very kind to her before
'Cause I was staying out at night, I guess it made her sore
And there were times that I thought she'd left me for good
But she wrote to me this morning, and she said she never couldEmbed"
606,Screw You (Young Man’s Blues) (Rare Masters),"Screw You (Young Man’s Blues) (Rare Masters) LyricsWhen I was a boy I had a lot of fun

She was scrubbing floors most of her life
They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use
Screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use
At the school I attended, I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane
They said screw you
Oh, you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
Screw you
Oh, you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
So you see there's men who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way screw you
I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear
He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence
For someone like you
Screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence
For someone like you
Screw you

It's cold in the winter, some freeze in the fall
The banquet's the supper that's set for the swine
If you're not at the gathering, and you've gone down the line

You're the last to arrive, you're the first one to leave
You don't give us the time, you don't drop us a line
Well a dime in the phone is the best way I know
You're the last to arrive, my friend you're the first one to go

The truck picks you up on your front porch at night
And you're back before sundown if you don't get blind
We're not chaining you down to your castle tonight
We're just trying to make you see some sort of light

They'll all drink your health out of pewter and wood
Get drunk in the hayloft playing dirty and good
There's ten pounds of oxen were skewered on spit
There'll not be an ounce if you don't make it quickEmbed"

I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

Released as a uk single in 1981

I remember yet before we met
That every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely woman

I remember meeting you
Discovering love can be so true
When it's shared by two instead of one

When you said you love me (when you said you love me)
We could not be parted (we could not be parted)
And i built my world around you (i built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that i found you
And loving you is sweeter than ever
(i ain't never felt like this before)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, sweeter than ever

Each night i pray we'd never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger
From day to day

As best i can, and how i try
To reassure and satisfy
'cause i'd be lost if you went away

'cause i really need you (really really need you)
And i need for you to need me too
(if you don't go breaking my heart)
I have built my world around you
(i have built my world around you)
Baby i'm so thankful that i've found you

And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever before
(i ain't never felt like this before)
And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
So much sweeter

That's what loving you (loving you)
'cause i really love (really really love you)
And i'm thankful that you love me too
(thankful that you love me too)
I have built my world around you
(i have built my world around you)
I am truly glad, i am truly glad
That loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(you don't know how much this means to me)
When i'm loving you
Me, you, us

Sweeter than ever (tell me about it)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(you don't know how much this means to me)
I'm loving you, you made my life sweeter than ever

Sweeter than ever (sweeter than ever)
So much sweeter (sweeter than ever)

Ah, shake it, baby
Yeah, you can shake it one time for me
Yeah-huh-huh-ha-ha, come on over, my baby
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Now let's get real low
Shake, baby, shake
All you gotta do, honey, is kinda stand in one spot
And wiggle around just a little bit
That's all you gotta do
Ooh baby, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Now let's go one time
Shake it, baby, shake it
Shake it, baby, shake
Come on over
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Shake it, baby shake
I said shake it, baby, shake it
I said shake it, baby, shake it
I said shake it, baby, shake it
Come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' onEmbed"
611,Never Say Goodbye,"Never Say Goodbye LyricsElton John
Miscellaneous
Never Say Goodbye
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Will ever be, ask one
What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Sudenely that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbyeEmbed"
612,Go Out and Get It,"Go Out and Get It LyricsAnd it's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people who made you cry

I believe in the ??? of every man
Where ??? take notice of ???
If you see the road turning straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid

I know a man, well he's six feet tall
Buckskin jacket ???
From the Boston town, yeah, is educated well
And he ??? about himself

Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lived a man ???
Behind his his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, anybody in the world can tellEmbed"
613,Stormbringer,"Stormbringer LyricsTime has gone by
The calendar leaves
I might try phoning
If I could think of the words to try

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall
She left in the morning
Was her way
And on returning
I find I have nothing to say

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
No, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fallEmbed"

Now the world has turned away
My life gets colder every day
You don't know how it is
I lost all my will to live
You've taken the love I have to give
You don't know how it is

(Chorus)
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

(Verse 2)
Well Sunday comes along with the wind
Every Sunday was spent with him
You don't know how it is
We would watch the flames burn higher
Tеll me Mama started to cry
You don't know how it is

Thank you Mama, you easе to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad

617,Sister of the Cross (Piano demo),"Sister of the Cross (Piano demo) Lyrics(Verse 1)
The old gates are always locked
By the daughter of the keys
Sad eyes are fixed on the world
From the balcony
While the six o'clock procession
Take their prayer books to the hall
It's sad to see them shed a tear
Inside the convent walls

(Verse 2)
Red mountains around them
Keep out those who'd come
But only birds and wild deer
Share the lives of nuns
For ladies who in kindness
Burn the knowledge they have found
Their knowledge lies inside a hole
Buried in the ground
(Chorus)
For the Sisters of the Cross
Seek the shadows that they have lost
In the walls where their lives
Are protected by God
But the feeling of love
Is somewhere in your bones
Your body is wasted
When it should have been owned

(Verse 3)
The Mother of the mission bells
Has lived here all her life
She never felt the hands of a man
Touch her in the night
And the canopies that cover her
So cold and so afraid
Thinking holy mothers die
Like spinsters in the grave

(Verse 4)
To be single in the chapel
Praying knelt down on your knees
Where the corridors are echoing
Their proud solemnity
And the candlelight against the glass
Plays shadow chasing tricks
As the young girls fall, their eyes in tears
Beside the crucifix
(Chorus)
For the Sisters of the Cross
Seek the shadows that they have lost
In the walls where their lives
Are protected by God
But the feeling of love
Is somewhere in your bones
Your body is wasted
When it should have been ownedEmbed"

It's a long long journey
When you're on your own
It's a long long way to travel
When you're all alone
So be careful and you'll find
That you're sure to make good time
'Cause your home

(Chorus)
I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

Don't you try and stop me
I made up my mind
I have been to many places
Where they treated me unkind

And not far to go
You have traveled many miles

620,The FIREBOY AND WATERGIRL 5: ELEMENTS | Madboyhub.com,"The FIREBOY AND WATERGIRL 5: ELEMENTS | Madboyhub.com LyricsUtilize the bolt keys to move Fireboy and the W,A,D keys to move Water girl. They can each touch their own component, yet can't contact the inverse. Neither can contact the green goo. Utilize their remarkable abilities to get past the level and to the ways out



This game has three every single new sanctuary: Fire, Water and Wind. Select them from the fundamental menu to complete the new Fireboy and Water girl experience





Components Temple is the most up to date game in the Fireboy and Water girl 5 establishment. In contrast to the past games in the arrangement, this game has a blend of 7 unique sanctuaries, each with 5 or 6 new levels. The sanctuaries in the game incorporate the 4 past sanctuaries in addition to 3 new sanctuaries: fire, water and wind. To approach the new sanctuaries, you should initially finish a couple of levels in the backwoods sanctuary



The game methodology proceeds with similar ideas as in the past games in the establishment. Fireboy and Watergirl should cooperate to finish each level. Fireboy should stay away from water pools and Watergirl should keep away from magma pools. Each level is a kind of puzzle where the members need to sort out the correct moves they should do to finish it. As you complete each level, gather however many jewels as you can to improve score. On the off chance that you discover a level to be too hard you can find support in the walkthrough video, later in this page


The Fire Temple levels are remarkable in light of the fact that they contain just magma pools that Fireboy can stroll around in and no water pools. Despite the fact that it appears to be a simple sanctuary for Fireboy it precisely the inverse. Fireboy should do all the difficult work to clear a path for Watergirl to have the option to arrive at its entryway. It is a joint exertion all things considered



The Water Temple is a similar idea as the Fire Temple just with water. All levels of the Water Temple have just water pools where Watergirl can stroll around openly. This doesn't mean a simple sanctuary for Watergirl. Watergirl should run in any event twice as much as Fireboy to track down a protected entry for her red pal
