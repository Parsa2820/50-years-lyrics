Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

6,A Day in the Life,"A Day in the Life Lyrics[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on
(Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten)
*alarm clock rings*
[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there

I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
""Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?""

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, ""It's time for bed""

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?21Embed"

23,Rocky Raccoon,"Rocky Raccoon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Chorus]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

[Chorus]
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Verse 1]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 1]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
[Bridge 2]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 3]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene

Writing fifty times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

Block that kick, block that kick!

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da

Birds for birding and fish for fishing

Unaware of his presence in the building

Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

How could she do this to me

By the banks of her own lagoon

She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weepsEmbed"

For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Bridge]
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

[Verse 3]
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

197,Yellow Submarine - Script,"Yellow Submarine - Script Lyrics[PROLOGUE]
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.

[00:01:49 THE BLUE MEANIES OVERLOOK PEPPERLAND]

CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX:
Yes, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The Bonkers?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Clowns?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Snapping Turks?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Anti-music missiles?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The dreadful Flying Glove?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!
[The first blue bubble encloses the stand where the band plays. Everybody runs scared.]

FRED:
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max.
MAX:
Someone running, Glove.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED [to the GLOVE, which is pointed him]:
It's not polite to point!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
FRED [to the MAYOR and other three people who are playing music.]:
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
FRED:
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
MAYOR:
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES:
Fire!

[One bomb gets one musician.]
FRED:
Trio, sir.

[Another bomb gets the second musician.]

FRED:
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?

[The third musician is hit with a bomb too.]

FRED:
Solo!
MAYOR:
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!

[FRED takes the MAYOR in his arms and runs.]

MAYOR:
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
FRED:
Our quartet?
MAYOR:
And foremothers...
FRED:
Another quartet?
MAYOR:
Made it in this yellow submarine...
FRED:
What, that little thing?
MAYOR:
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred.
FRED:
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
MAYOR:
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
FRED:
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
MAYOR:
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
FRED:
Where should I go?
MAYOR:
No time for trivialities.
[As the BLUE MEANIES bomb the MAYOR, FRED sails away.]

CREDITS
[0:07:41 THE BEATLES: YELLOW SUBMARINE]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
…
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain.
Full speed ahead.
Full speed it is, sir.
Action stations! Action stations!
Aye, sir, aye.
Captain, Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine,
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine,
…

[0:10:20 THE YELLOW SUBMARINE GETS TO LIVERPOOL]

[0:11:03 THE BEATLES: ELEANOR RIGBY]
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?

[0:13:14 STREET OF LIVERPOOL]

RINGO:
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.

[As RINGO walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the floor playing with a cat.]

BOBBY:
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. [The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er...
RINGO:
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
BOBBY:
No, I would not.
RINGO:
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.

[Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house where he lives with the other Beatles.]

RINGO:
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.

[RINGO enters the house. FRED comes and knocks at the door.]

FRED:
Help, help, help!
RINGO [from inside]:
Thanks, I don't need any.
FRED:
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
RINGO:
Be specific.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What you need is...
FRED:
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.

[0:16:08 THE HOUSE OF THE BEATLES]

[Door opens and Fred enters. There is a long corridor with many doors. A lot of strange things enter and leave the rooms.]

VOZ:
Hiya, baby!

[RINGO goes downstairs in a car.]

RINGO:
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
FRED:
Bless you!
RINGO:
Did I sneeze?

[They return to the corridor.]

FRED:
Just park it here.
RINGO:
I'll just park it here.

[They enter through a door.]

FRED:
What would your friends be doing here?
RINGO:
Displaying.
FRED:
Displaying what?
RINGO:
Displaying around.

[The room is full of interesting objects, like a museum.]

FRED:
Can't we take one of these?
RINGO:
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
FRED:
Frankenstein?
RINGO:
I used to go out with his sister.
FRED:
His sister?
RINGO:
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
FRED:
You mustn't do that.
RINGO:
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.

[He does it. Frankenstein gets up and takes a drink. Then he becomes JOHN.]

JOHN:
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
RINGO:
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What do you think?
JOHN:
I think he needs a rehearsal.

[They return to the hall.]

JOHN:
When do we leave?
RINGO:
Let's get the other two, John.
JOHN:
What day is it?
RINGO:
Sitar-day.
JOHN:
Then George will be here.

[He opens a door. Indian images.]

[0:18:55 THE BEATLES: LOVE YOU TO (beginning)]

RINGO:
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE [driving a red car]:
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
RINGO [pointing to FRED]:
This chap here...
FRED [JOHN and RINGO also say the last words]:
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE:
You're nuts, the pair of you.
RINGO:
Wait a minute, that's my car.
GEORGE:
How do you know it's your car?
RINGO:
I'd know it anywhere.
GEORGE:
What's it look like, then?
RINGO:
It's red with yellow wheels. [The car changes colours]I mean, blue with orange wheels.
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.

[They all get into the car.]

RINGO:
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
GEORGE:
I got here first.

[They argue about who will drive.]

RINGO/GEORGE:
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.

[Finally, they depart. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs the girl.]

JOHN:
Do you think we're interrupting something?
RINGO:
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?

[JOHN opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes the door, scared.]

GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
JOHN:
Try one of those doors.

[RINGO opens a door. Inside the room there is a loud party.]

GEORGE:
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
RINGO:
Yes, they do.
JOHN:
They do, though, don't they?
GEORGE:
Yes, they do.
RINGO:
Don't dey, dough?
GEORGE:
Dough?

[PAUL meets them.]

JOHN:
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL:
What's the matter, folks?
RINGO:
Blue Meanies.
FRED:
Well, lads, what do you think?
JOHN [as they walk]:
I think that...
FRED:
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
PAUL:
Well, then, um...
FRED:
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
JOHN:
Well, I think that...
RINGO:
As a matter of fact, I...
ALL BEATLES:
I think...
FRED:
Well?
RINGO:
I've forgotten.

[They all go outside and stop in front of the submarine.]

FRED:
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
JOHN:
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.

[0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS]

We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.

[0:22:45 INSIDE THE SUBMARINE]

PAUL:
So, this is a submarine.
JOHN:
Soft, isn't it?
RINGO:
Not if you're on the bottom.
FRED:
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
PAUL:
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
FRED:
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
JOHN:
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
FRED:
Then you start looking for a switch.
RINGO:
Perhaps this is it.

[The submarine sails into a strange world.]

[0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW]
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)
All together now (all together now),
all together now (all together now)...
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…

[0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME]

RINGO:
What time is it?
JOHN:
It's time to time.
PAUL:
Look, the hands are slowing down.

[The submarine sails backwards.]

PAUL:
Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN:
Yeah.
PAUL:
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
RINGO:
What's happening, John?
JOHN:
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
GEORGE:
All right.
JOHN:
Relatively speaking, that is.
GEORGE:
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
RINGO:
What for?
GEORGE:
Shorter hours.
RINGO:
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL:
Why?
RINGO:
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
JOHN:
You surprise me, Ringo.
RINGO:
Why?
JOHN:
Dealing in abstracts.
RINGO:
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.

[RINGO shrinks, becoming younger]

PAUL [also getting younger]:
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE [getting younger]
Look, everything's getting bigger.
JOHN [getting younger]:
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
RINGO [mourning]:
I want my mam.
FRED:
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO [pointing outside]
Look at that!
GEORGE:
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
JOHN:
It's not. It's Father Time.
GEORGE:
How do you know?
JOHN:
I read it in a book.
FRED:
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
GEORGE:
What's that mean, old Fred?
FRED:
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
JOHN:
What are we gonna do, then?
FRED:
We could always try a few buttons.
RINGO [sobbing]:
I want my mam.
FRED:
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
JOHN:
Can't we do something to the clock?
GEORGE:
What do you mean, John?
JOHN:
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
FRED:
Clever lad.

[JOHN forces the clockwise and the submarine goes forwards.]

JOHN:
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
PAUL [looking outside]:
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
JOHN:
Uncannily.
RINGO:
There's someone in it. Look.
JOHN:
And they're waving.
RINGO:
It's a group of fellas.
JOHN:
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
RINGO:
There's only two of us.
JOHN:
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
FRED:
Going backwards...
JOHN:
… in time!
GEORGE:
Look at Ringo.

[RINGO is getting older, and so the rest.]

JOHN:
Oh dear, we're all the same.
PAUL:
Senile delinquents.
GEORGE:
And I can hear my beard growing.
RINGO:
We'd better do something.

[0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I’M SIXTY FOUR]
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older, too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
[As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age.]
[A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
[A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64, matching the last one with the end of the song.]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

JOHN:
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
RINGO:
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
JOHN:
What kind of a sea is this?
FRED:
The Sea of Science.
JOHN:
Oh, yeah.

[0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter
What clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there.

[0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS]

[As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back to the submarine a strange animal enters with them.]

GEORGE:
He looks wrong.
PAUL:
He doesn't look at all well.
GEORGE:
In fact, he's horrible.
JOHN [hiding.]:
He's so ugly.
ALL:
Really ugly!

[The animal breaks to mourn.]

FRED:
Somebody push a button.

[RINGO does so and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters.]

[0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS]

JOHN:
There's a cyclops.
PAUL:
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
JOHN:
Then it must be a bi-cyclops.
GEORGE:
There's another one.
JOHN:
A whole cyclopedia.

[Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything like a vacuum. The BEATLES look out the hatch.]

JOHN:
There's a school of whales.
RINGO:
They look a bit old for school.
PAUL:
University, then.
RINGO [driving the submarine]:
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
FRED:
You've got to steer clear!
RINGO:
Steer clear?
FRED:
Yes, steer. Clear?
RINGO:
Yes, dear.

[RINGO presses a button. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too.]

FRED:
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
RINGO:
Which button?
FRED:
That one.
RINGO:
This one?

[RINGO presses the button and is ejected from the submarine onto the back of a dinosaur. Before he is eaten, he is rescued by a horse-like creature.]

FRED:
That was the panic button.
PAUL:
Poor Ringo.
JOHN:
Poor lad.
GEORGE:
Never did no harm to no-one.
JOHN:
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
FRED:
Learn to sing trios.
PAUL:
No, let's save the poor devil.
JOHN:
I see footsteps.
FRED:
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
JOHN:
Preparing to attack.

[The boots try to step on the submarine, but PAUL presses a button and the submarine steps on the boots.]

JOHN:
I don't half miss Ringo.
PAUL:
He's far out there.
JOHN:
Always was.
RINGO:
'H' is for hurry!
PAUL:
Here comes Ringo!

[RINGO rides the horse creature.]

JOHN:
There goes Ringo.

[A boxing monster approaches the submarine.]

GEORGE:
It's seen us.
FRED:
Find a boxing button.
PAUL:
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
JOHN:
Who cares? Find one.

[The boxing monster hits the submarine.]

FRED [pushing a button]:
Fire one!

[The submarine expels lot of strange gadgets, including a banner with the words “The Rolling Stones”.]

FRED:
Uh-oh, wrong one.
JOHN:
That.

[The submarine flatters the monsters with a cigar. We hear “Air on the G-string”, de Bach until the cigar explodes.]

GEORGE:
There goes Ringo again.
JOHN:
Rides well, doesn't he?
RINGO:
'E' is for ergent...

[The vacuum monster appears again.]

FRED:
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
PAUL:
We'll be sucked into oblivion.
GEORGE:
Or even further.
FRED:
Put her in reverse.
JOHN:
So long, sucker.
PAUL:
Too much.
GEORGE:
Too soon.
FRED:
Reverse! Reverse!
JOHN:
Ringo time.

[Another monster is swallowed by the vacuum monster.]

RINGO:
'L' is for love me...

[Indians go chasing RINGO.]

JOHN:
Indians!
RINGO:
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
JOHN:
So, press a button.

[0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues RINGO.]

JOHN:
How was it, Ringo?
RINGO [pulling arrows off himself]:
'Arrowing.

[The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters.]

FRED:
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
RINGO:
Oh, no.
JOHN:
The motor's packing in.
FRED:
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?
PAUL:
Serve tea.
JOHN:
Lovely.

[The vacuum monster swallows everything, including itself.]

[The submarine is left in nothing.]

FRED:
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
JOHN:
Maybe we should call a road service.
PAUL:
Can't. No road.
RINGO:
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:
Subscribers! Oh!
GEORGE:
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
FRED:
Here.
GEORGE:
Is that the motor?
FRED:
Can't you tell one when you see one?
GEORGE:
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.

[Put his finger on the motor and get shocked.]

JOHN:
What do you think?
GEORGE:
I think I burned my finger.
RINGO [looking outside]:
Here, lads. Look at this.
JOHN:
What do you think it is?
GEORGE:
Nothing.
RINGO:
Looks like nothing.
PAUL:
It's a local inhabitant.
RINGO:
He's probably one of the nothings.
PAUL:
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
JOHN:
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
GEORGE:
But this is a nobody.

Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
JOHN:
Can you tell us where we're at?
JEREMY:
A true Socratic query, that.
JOHN:
And who the Billy Shears are you?
JEREMY:
Who? Who indeed am I?

[He gives a different visiting card to each BEATLE.]

JOHN [reading card]:
Jeremy?
PAUL [reading card]:
Hillary?
GEORGE [reading card]:
Boob?
RINGO [reading card]:
Ph. D?
ALL:
Who?
JEREMY:
Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
JOHN:
Lousy poet.
JEREMY:
Critic's voice, take your choice.
RINGO:
Must be one of them angry young men.
PAUL:
Or a daffy old creep.
JEREMY:
I, daffy old creep?
GEORGE:
Do you speak English?
JEREMY:
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
PAUL:
Well, do you speak English?
JEREMY:
You know, I'm not sure.
RINGO:
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
PAUL:
Why don't we show him our motor?
JOHN:
Should we really... show him our motor?
PAUL:
He may not have seen one before.
JEREMY:
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
This motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
JOHN:
He fixed it?
PAUL:
He fixed it.
GEORGE:
Great. Let's go.
JEREMY:
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
JOHN:
Must you always talk in rhyme?
JEREMY:
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
PAUL:
Hey, fellas. Look.
JEREMY:
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
GEORGE:
A boob for all seasons.
PAUL:
How can he lose?
JOHN:
Were your notices good?
JEREMY:
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
JOHN:
There must be a word for what he is.

[0:43:00 THE BEATLES: NOWHERE MAN]
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody

JOHN:
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
RINGO:
What about him?
JOHN:
He's happy enough going around in circles.
RINGO:
Poor little fella.
PAUL:
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
RINGO:
Look at him. Can't he come with us? [Goes over to JEREMY]
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
JEREMY:
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
RINGO:
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.

[Inside the submarine, JOHN gives FRED the motor.]

JOHN [to JEREMY]
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
JEREMY [laughing]:
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
It's usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
JOHN:
That's the hatch, friend.
JEREMY:
Indeed.
FRED:
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
GEORGE:
Forward.
PAUL:
Forward.
JOHN:
Forward.
RINGO:
Forward.
ALL:
Forward!

[But the submarine has problems going forward.]

JOHN:
It's awfully quiet.
GEORGE:
What shall we do, Jeremy?
JEREMY:
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

[The BEATLES and JEREMY go outside.]

JEREMY:
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
JOHN:
What's he saying?
PAUL:
What's he doing?
JEREMY:
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.

[The submarine stars, but only FRED is on board.]

FRED:
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
JOHN:
'P' is for... goodbye?
GEORGE:
That was lovely, Jeremy.
PAUL:
We've lost the sub for good.
JOHN:
Or for bad. Or for worse.
JEREMY:
I'm sorry about that.
RINGO:
But he did fix the motor.
PAUL:
Where are we?

[They stand on a head. There are a lot of heads around.]

JOHN:
It looks like the foothills.
PAUL:
The foothills of what?
JOHN:
The foothills of the headlands.

[0:48:06 THE BEATLES: LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters
with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…

[0:51:09 ON THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HEADLANDS]

JOHN:
Carry on, lads, carry on.
RINGO:
Certainly was carrying on.
JOHN:
I feel a draft.
PAUL:
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
JOHN [talking to a mass of heads]
Excuse us...
PAUL:
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?

[The heads point arrows, but the arrows point in circles.]

JOHN:
Thanks.
PAUL:
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
JEREMY:
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
RINGO:
Condi...
JEREMY:
A spice.
JOHN:
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
PAUL:
Pepper?
GEORGE:
Pepper.

[They smell and sneeze. The mass of heads sneeze too. They fly into the Sea of Holes.]

[0:52:08 THE SEA OF HOLES]

RINGO:
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
PAUL:
Oh, boy...
GEORGE:
How many do you think there are in all?
JEREMY:
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
PAUL:
Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green?
JOHN:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
JEREMY:
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
JOHN:
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
JEREMY:
There are simply no holes in my education.
PAUL:
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
GEORGE:
Great. What shall we do?
JEREMY:
Be empirical. Look.
RINGO:
The booby's making more and more sense.
PAUL:
It's getting better all the time.
JOHN:
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
JEREMY:
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.

[JEREMY is caught by the leg by a BLUE MEANIE. RINGO picks a hole up and plays with it for a while before to put it in his pocket.]

RINGO:
I've got a hole in me pocket.
PAUL:
Where's Jeremy?
JOHN:
He was over there.
GEORGE:
He's not here now.
PAUL:
He must have jumped ship, then.
RINGO:
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?

[0:54:29 Suddenly, everything is tinted of green as we hear a bit part of the song Yellow submarine: “Sea of green, sea of green, sea of green, green, green, green...”]

[The BEATLES arrive in Pepperland, just on the base of the temple.]

[0:54:41 PEPPERLAND]

JOHN:
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
GEORGE:
And drab.
PAUL:
And quiet.

[RINGO finds a pile of apples. He takes one and passes it to PAUL.]

JOHN:
Safe at last.
PAUL:
And none the worse for our adventures.
JOHN:
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
RINGO:
There's an eye in the apples.

[RINGO brings down the pile of apples and uncovers the MAYOR. The Yellow Submarine comes down from the sky and lands on the house of music. FRED descends sitting down in an anchor.]

FRED:
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
GEORGE:
Who's this?
FRED:
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. [Ringo removes the apples]. Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
JOHN:
All right, let's sing.

[0:55:54 THE BEATLES: HAVE YOU GOT TIME TO RECTIFY]
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...

MAYOR:
Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred?
FRED:
You do, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR:
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
FRED:
Yes, yes. Look.
MAYOR:
Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
PAUL:
We're quite cute, really.
MAYOR:
You could pass for the originals.
JOHN:
We are the originals.

[They go downstairs from the house of music.]

MAYOR:
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
RINGO:
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
MAYOR
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
FRED
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
PAUL
They hate music that much, do they?
MAYOR
They shrink at the very sound.
JOHN
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
PAUL
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
JOHN
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
JOHN
Coagulate with the crowd.
PAUL
Cut-outs at the ready.
JOHN
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
PAUL
What a grand bandstand.
JOHN
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
GEORGE
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
PAUL
All right, the coast is clear.
GEORGE
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
GEORGE
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
BLUE MEANIE
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
RINGO
It's not very light in here, is it?
GEORGE
Shh! Keep the noise down.
JOHN
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
PAUL
Nice bit of gear, that.
RINGO
They'll look great on, eh?
PAUL
Dey will, won't dey?
RINGO
Won't dey, dough.
JOHN
How do I look?
PAUL
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
GEORGE
Oh, heck.
RINGO
A million billion Meanies.
PAUL
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
PAUL
Do you think they heard us?
JOHN
I hope not.
GEORGE
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
GEORGE
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
PAUL
Look. They're all asleep.
RINGO
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
GEORGE
Come on. Let's get out of here.
PAUL
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
RINGO
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
PAUL
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
GEORGE
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
JOHN
Not even a teeny Meanie.
PAUL
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
RINGO
Great.
PAUL
Oh, look. Breakfast.
RINGO
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
JOHN
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
JOHN
Five.
CHIEF
Five? [John eliminates the last one with an apple stroke.] Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three...
JOHN
Four.
John eliminates another one.
TALL MEANIES
One, two...
JOHN
Three.
CHIEF
Three?
JOHN
Two.
CHIEF
Two?
JOHN
One.
CHIEF
One? [The chief stares at the column made of the four Beatles] Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
JOHN
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
PAUL
Right, men. We've made it.
GEORGE
Instruments at the ready.
JOHN
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
RINGO
Hey, can't you make it three?
JOHN
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you,
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really wanna stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you,
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Who is responsible for this?
ASSISTANT
Rimsky Korsakov?
The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
ASSISTANT
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. [Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Who? Who? Who?
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts. [New rage] Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
GEORGE
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
RINGO
Open your mouth, it won't hurt. [Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
GEORGE
It's easy. All you need is love.
JOHN
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love (x3)
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, (All together now)
All you need is love, (Everybody)
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
JOHN
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
RINGO
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
GEORGE
Hey, wait, and watch. [Floating] It's all in the mind, you know.
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue glass ball.
GEORGE
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
JOHN
In Pepperland all things are possible.
PAUL
It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO
Just a big glass bowl, then.
PAUL
Yes, blue glass.
RINGO
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
JOHN
There's something inside.
RINGO
Four fellas.
GEORGE
What are they doing there?
PAUL
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
JOHN
It can't be.
PAUL
It's us.
JOHN
But we're here.
PAUL
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
RINGO
Lonely...
GEORGE
Hearts Club...
GEORGE
Band.
JOHN
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
JOHN
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
PAUL
John!
JOHN
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
GEORGE
John!
JOHN
George?
GEORGE
How do we get them out?
JOHN
Break the glass.
GEORGE
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
JOHN
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
RINGO
No, I haven't.
GEORGE
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard.
RINGO
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
RINGO
Yeah, it still works.
GEORGE
We take back all we said.
JOHN
You're a genius.
PAUL
A sheer genius.
RINGO
I know, I know, I know. [Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly.
GEORGE
Like crystal.
PAUL
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
RINGO
Yeah, without a doubt.
GEORGE
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
JOHN
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
JOHN
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. [They walk together] I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
JOHN 2
Shall we hence?
PAUL
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
JOHN
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog (x4)
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
RINGO
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
RINGO
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
JEREMY
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?
[With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ]
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
RINGO
Jeremy!
JEREMY
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
My kingdom for a horse! [Jeremy comes close to him] I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
JEREMY
He does, does he?
CHIEF
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
JEREMY
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
CHIEF
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
JEREMY
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,
[Opens the manual]
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
[Suddenly, a rose arise in the Chief nose]
A rosy nose?
CHIEF
Speak your last piece!
JEREMY
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
RINGO
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
JOHN
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
CHIEF
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
MAX
Argentina?
JOHN
Are you with us? Will you join?
CHIEF
Shall we?
MAX
No!... [Chief threatens to hit him] Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
CHIEF
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON
PAUL
Catchy tune, that.
RINGO
I can't seem to get it out of my head.
GEORGE
Then shake it.
RINGO
That's what we've been doing all night.
PAUL
Yeah, it was a great party.
GEORGE
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
PAUL
I've got a little love.
RINGO
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
PAUL
A hole?
RINGO
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
GEORGE
What can he do with half a hole?
PAUL
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
RINGO
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
PAUL
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
JOHN
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
GEORGE
How's that?
JOHN
Singing!
RINGO
One...
PAUL
Two...
GEORGE
Three...
JOHN
¡Fire!
1:27:33 THE BEATLES : ALL TOGETHER NOW

They expect it, don't they.

Lovely lads and so natural.

Ow!

It's cold. it's a cold place.

I mean, with a fishing rod.
7:57 - 8:01
I wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?

denominational nuggets. Unmarked.
9:14 - 9:17
- Not a mark on them.
- No, I hate them.
9:17 - 9:23
- No.
- It makes your fingers go green.
9:23 - 9:26
It's not the Beatle with the ring.
9:26 - 9:30
- Aren't I?
- No, unfortunately.
9:30 - 9:37

You shall have fun, eh?

No thanks, I'm rhythm guitar

at a mystical impulse...
17:02 - 17:07
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
17:07 - 17:12
And will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.

Of course I don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...

What? Who? Where?

Now... lf you'll pardon me.
17:49 - 17:52
It's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
17:52 - 17:54
- Very nice.
- It's yours.
17:54 - 17:58
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!
17:58 - 18:02
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
18:02 - 18:06
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
18:06 - 18:10
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
18:10 - 18:15
I tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
18:15 - 18:17
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!
18:17 - 18:20
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
18:20 - 18:23
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?
18:23 - 18:26
Very nice he was, too.
18:26 - 18:39
I think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
18:39 - 18:42
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
18:42 - 18:44
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
18:44 - 18:47
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
18:47 - 18:49
Is this ring nasty, sir?
18:49 - 18:55
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
18:55 - 18:59
Oh! That's better.
18:59 - 19:02
Excuse me...
This menu...

Hey, did you...
19:41 - 19:46

Arthur?

- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
20:27 - 20:29
He has three hours to live.
20:29 - 20:33
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
20:33 - 20:35
I ordered soup too.
20:35 - 20:48
- Soup!
- Soup.
20:48 - 20:53
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
(Gasps) Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
(Woman screams)
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
(Laughs)
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
(Whirring)
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
(Electronic beeping)
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.
24:14 - 24:17
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
(Electronic humming)
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
(Whirring)
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
26:55 - 27:01
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
27:01 - 27:04
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
27:32 - 27:35
(Laser Beeps)
27:35 - 27:38
(Bang)
27:38 - 27:42
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
27:42 - 27:50
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

No! it is Clang, the High Priest,

you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
30:10 - 30:13

30:13 - 30:16
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
30:16 - 30:21
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
30:21 - 30:24
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.

Be brave.

this would not be necessary.
30:55 - 31:05

31:05 - 31:08

You've been up that temple again.

You're as bad as your sister, coming

31:21 - 31:23
There might be some insurance.

I wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.

That one with the large ned.
35:46 - 35:48
Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
35:54 - 35:56
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09
With a ring like that
could I interest the military?
36:09 - 36:11
No, I could not.

I can't get it off.

- Algernon, my little black bag.
36:24 - 36:27
I shall have to operate.

It'll be on the National Health,
won't it?

- Look!
36:33 - 36:36
Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!
36:36 - 36:39

- No that's not me.

I'm glad it wore off quickly.

Think on it.

I don't understand a word.
I don't speak the language.
37:37 - 37:40
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.

Ah, the ring! Come on, we go.

I'm chucking one in.

One card. Dealer takes one.

See, that didn't hurt.
59:22 - 59:26
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.
59:26 - 59:29
Well, I don't just drum with it, do I?
59:29 - 59:31
- What else then?
- I use it, you know.
59:31 - 59:35
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
I'll raise you.

You haven't used that finger
in the past hour and we're in danger.

- You're joking!

Just hold this drumstick.
60:11 - 60:14
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.

Look John, I've had some great times
with this finger.
65:15 - 65:17
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?

Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one

Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know

Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big

You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

About the space between us all
And the people

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too

[John] Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show

[All] (whistling)

[John] This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:

Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too
[Paul] This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing

[John] Yes! Yes! Oh yes!

[Paul] Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...

[John] Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!

[Paul] ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...

[All] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!

[Paul] ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription

[John] Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy

Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...

King Wenceslas:

Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)

Hooray!

Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

(My darling
When you brought me that toast the other morning
I, I looked into your eye
And I could see a National Health eyeball
And I loved you, like I've never done
Like I've never done before!)

Well the stars (well the stars)
They shine (oh, they shine)
And you'll be mine
Oh, you will be mine
You'll be mine

254,Sour Milk Sea,"Sour Milk Sea Lyrics[Verse 1]
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon, you don't have long

[Chorus 1]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

[Verse 2]
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there

[Chorus 2]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 3]
Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way really brings results

[Chorus 3]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on thereEmbed"

And every little thing that you do
And I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
And I'm telling the world you make me feel proud
You make me want to shout out aloud
So I'm telling all my friends I'm in love

Oh, I'm feeling on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
I've never felt this way before
If this is love, give me more, more, more, more

...I'm telling you
...thing that you do

I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love

256,Don’t Ever Change,"Don’t Ever Change Lyrics[Verse 1]
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are

[Verse 2]
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

[Bridge]
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So, how can I get tired of you?
[Verse 3]
Now, lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

[Outro]
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever changeEmbed"

She...!

[John]  It's the case of one awful one after another!
What's  it the case of, Mr. Martin?

[George Martin] Take four was very good up to the breakdown...

[John] Which was take four?

[George  Martin] ...and it was very good until the end bit there when Paul did his bit that wasn't quite right

[John]  My boys are ready to go!

[Glyn Johns] John?

[John]  Yes? What?

[Glyn Johns] It is possible without affecting yourselves too much to turn down a little? Apparently there's been a complaint

[John] From who?
[Glyn Johns] From somebody outside the building

[John]  What are they doing here at this time of night?

[Ringo] It's that guy

[John] What guy?

[Ringo] The last time, he complained...

[Paul] It's his own fault for getting a house in such a lousy district!

[John] Well, we'll try it once more very loud
And if we don't get it, we'll try it quiet like you might do it the other way
Okay, the loud one, last go
Last chance to be loud!

[George Harrison] Who says?

[John] Can't quite see through these now
I just can't see them, they keep merging

One-two-three, one-two-three

1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
[Bridge 2]
I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at the trouble and pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Gently weeps
Still my guitar gently weepsEmbed"

There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo-Fanques Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
'ving been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Yeah-yeah-yeah...
Yeaahhh, yeah-yeah-yeah...
Coming down fast, but I'm miles above you...
Yeaahhh...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, c'mon, tell me the answer...
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
Yeaahhh...Embed"

To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me

They said that love was a lie

Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me

And love comes love shows

He was a fool unto himself

Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon
He was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him

[SUNG]

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
Said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
The doctor walked in sminking of gin (laugh) [Sminking?]
And proceeded to lie on the table
He's really sminking of gin
And it did him in the end [Poor doc.]

Meantime back on the table, yeah
The doctor said, ""Rock, you met your match, son""
Rocky said, ""it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon""
""You better be, better soon,"" said the doc
Come on son, gotta get hip
Gotta get up
Gotta get back to your gun
Gotta go show that Danny Boy

However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Da da da da...
That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon


[SPOKEN]
Now Rocky Racoon
Got up from his room and he walked out through the swing doors of the local saloon
Straight into the arms of someone new
Someone who he'd known from a long way back
Maybe from his primary school days
A young friend Rocky had recognized
[HALF-SPOKEN-HALF-SUNG]
He said, ""honey, will you be my new honey-bunch""
She said ""Rocky boy, come on, I'll show you why I love you.""
""Young Rocky Racoon, I love the way you wear your hat
Love the way you hid your pants, Rocky Raccoon, I dig you""

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile

I met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine

Got so much skills and such a beautiful will
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

Promised someday she will be my bride

Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me

And if you say the word
I could stay with you

When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear

Indicate precisely what you mean to say

Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
In a million years. They were together man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
Kept calling them one way oranother (you know howitis)
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities
Including some of there beast friends. Being in love
They cloong together even more man. But some of the
Poisonessmonsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
The dry cleaners. Luckily this did not kill them and
They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
Hopefully ever after and who could blame them

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

When they get a crowd

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked

If you became nakedEmbed"

And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye

He said, ""I’m gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
[Instrumental bridge]

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I’ll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible

To help with good Rocky's revival

Came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain

I tell you just why you know I don’t lie

It’s been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it’s a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles’ hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright

I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don’t you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!

When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don’t buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it’s a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don’t have Georgia Brown

Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh

Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens

Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!

In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

431,Recording Notes,"Recording Notes LyricsTo complete the many songs needed for their double-LP, The Beatles recorded regularly during twenty weeks from 30th May to 16th October 1968. The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine.

Since 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. 'Bouncing Down' was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed.

Work began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be 'bounced down' to a second, third, or even - as with 'Revolution 1' and 'Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da' - a fourth tape. The Beatles' first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. As it had been started  on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing.

However, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. George's decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group.

The album's long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the Abbey Road. Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the Magical Mystery Tour songs, recored and mixed two thirds of 'The White Album'. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions.Embed"

Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

Dragged a comb across my head

And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

444,Historical Notes,"Historical Notes LyricsThe group's ninth album in the UK was called simply The Beatles but quickly became better known as 'The White Album'. The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968.

The Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single 'Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution'. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising The Beatles.

Any expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of 'The Beatles' embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other.

Despite being an expensive double album, The Beatles was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with Sgt. Pepper, no singles were released from 'The White Album' in the UK and USA during the sixties.

Amid the sessions for The Beatles, the animated film Yellow Submarine was given it's UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of The Beatles.Embed"

But it's no joke, it's doing me harm

And ya know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
(Woo!)
[Verse 2]

Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink

But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

When I hold you in your arms
When you show each one of your charms
I wonder, should I get up
And go to the funny farm
No, no, no

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain

For a little peace of mind (woo!)
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind (woo!)
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one

Nothing to do it's up to you

And you're on your own, you're in the street

Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head

Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

To shoot off the legs of his rival

By stealing the girl of his fancy

Were in the next room at the hoedown

He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
Now, Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

And of course, Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

And Mr. H. will demonstrate

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques'fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
And lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messers K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the billEmbed"

613,Beatles For Sale - Foreward,"Beatles For Sale - Foreward LyricsThis is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'.

The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve!

It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today.

For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world.

This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous.

Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture.

At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and I'm A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands.

There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case.

Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case.

Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.Embed"

This happened once before
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home that's a lie
Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door (your face)
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
Your face

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin' down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeah, she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it
Come on, Queenie, let's shake it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
I said, Go, go, go, little Queenie
Ahh, go, go, go, go!
[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

Well, there she is a-dancin'
Over by the record machine
Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
Yeah, she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, well, she's thinkin'
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, I'm gonna get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Said, c'mon queenie, Ahh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Queenie, Go! Go, go, queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie

Meanwhile, I was still thinkin'
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it

629,Penny Lane (Anthology 2 Version),"Penny Lane (Anthology 2 Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

""Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen
Twenty""

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Made my way upstairs and had a smoke
And everybody spoke and I went into a dream

""Oh shit""

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you
""See the worst thing about doing this
Doing something like this
Is I think that at first people sort of are a bit suspicious
'You know, come on, what are you up to?'Embed"

I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile

834,Mean Mr. Mustard (Anthology 3 Version),"Mean Mr. Mustard (Anthology 3 Version) LyricsMean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

He's such a mean old man
He's such a mean old man

His sister Shelly works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter

Takes him out to look to look at the Queen
The only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

He's such a dirty old man
He's such a dirty old man
Hey Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Save enough to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

836,Fab Four on Film,"Fab Four on Film LyricsINTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors?

PAUL: No.

GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day’s Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won’t make us feel as though we’re actors. But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film.

RINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it. [laughs] You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.

PAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We’d sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it’s about the grandfather in the film who goes off to—

RINGO: Well, we can’t tell you, ‘cause we’ll ruin the film, you see!

PAUL: We can’t tell you [inaudible] but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It’s all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it’s not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he’s sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor! [laughter] And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!” [sound of arms flapping; laughs] Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.

RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.

PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. [laughs]
RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: They cut some of it.

RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.Embed"

Tasting much sweeter than wine
Do do do
Do do do
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey (a taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Do do do
Do do do
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back (he'll come back)
For the honey (for the honey)
And youEmbed"

Laisse moi t'emmener
Car je vais à Strawberry Fields
Rien n'est réel
Et pas de quoi s'énerver
Strawberry Fields pour toujours

Vivre est facile avec les yeux fermés
Sans comprendre tout ce que tu vois
Ça devient dur de devenir quelqu'un
Mais tout s'arrange
Ça ne m'importe pas beaucoup

Laisse moi t'emmener
Car je vais à Strawberry Fields
Rien n'est réel
Et pas de quoi s'énerver

Je pense que personne n'est dans mon arbre
Je veux dire, il peut être haut ou bas
C'est pourquoi tu ne reçois pas la tonalité
Mais ça va
Je veux dire que ce n'est pas trop mal
*(refrain)*
Laisse moi t'emmener
Car je vais à Strawberry Fields
Rien n'est réel
Et pas de quoi s'énerver

Toujours, non, parfois je pense que c'est moi
Mais tu sais, je sais quand ce n'est qu'un rêve
Je pense que je sais, je dis -ah oui
Mais c'est entièrement faux
C'est à dire que je crois ne pas être d'accord
