When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

12,Same Ol’ Mistakes,"Same Ol’ Mistakes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know
[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)133Embed"

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts

Turned into a real sticky situation

We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

A lost connection, oh, come back to me

Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say

Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly

Because we both know where I'm about to go

All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)

Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you
[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door (Let you enter my door)
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed (Using like I bleed)

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna & Justin Timberlake]
It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)
Baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
It's like I checked into rehab

Part I: Love Without Tragedy

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

[Verse]
I ask you, ""What's the matter?""
You say ""Oh, it's nothing at all.""
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice
[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

[Chorus]
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
(Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
[Verse 2]
Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I’m moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearin' fox furs, rockin' oxfords
Eatin' oxtails, sippin' Cockspur
Silly motherfuckers lookin' awkward
So much dick ridin' that my cock hurt
(Pause), we runnin' clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3 come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your coucou
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it play games like soccer when we kick it

Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""Give me back my swag,"" they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist

(This feels, like, so real) Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help
[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel
[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this

Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

Don't look back, just carry on

Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold (Ooh)

Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh
[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is ""You Idiot"" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
[Bridge]
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

[Chorus]
This is stupid (No, no), I'm not stupid (No, no, no)
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Like I'm stupid)

Take it to the tele and make her a victim

72,Cry,"Cry Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole ""in love"" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel
[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Verse 2]
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give it to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?

And it cut me like a knife

But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Bridge]
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)

And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it

You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

You showed me things that I'll never forget

Nobody else can do it quite like I do

But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me

What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)

But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie
[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn it up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped?
Do you like rough sex? Hit 'em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet?
Le-le-let's go, you rockin' with Cole, it's the best flow
Put the game on lock while those lame-os watch
I'm on fire, they are not, I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch, I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you gone bad, you only got badder

99,Question Existing,"Question Existing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
[Verse 2]
Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Spoken]
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am
[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I woulda put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you

Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no

I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss
[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 3]
I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love
[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?

Before you speak, listen
I always make it happen
I don’t believe in wishing or wishes or should've or would've or could've or can't or won't
So don’t, don’t come to me with that there
Epitome of irony, I’m a gentleman bastard
Burn me, throw me in the ocean, ya'll can keep the casket
I see who you not so let's see how long that mask fit
My whole life’s been a flagrant fail but somehow I still made the basket
Yeah they all tough behind the mic, I bet
Until they get they ass kicked
I’m a diamond in the rough I ain't cut right
And make sure when you cutting things that they're cut right
I don't floss, I don't rock ice, but if you listen and learn
Then I just might
Show you how I took my life from soft white
To playing cards with Rihanna at the same night
In Tokyo baby, let's ride
Now that’s what you call two diamonds in the sky

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?

I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me

My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

Trust me 'cause I know it's true
You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Get dem haters out your circle (Believe me when I tell you)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (No, no)

You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty

128,Goodbye,"Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
I rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more

[Chorus]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye
[Verse 2]
Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

[Chorus]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say

Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

136,The Last Time,"The Last Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
[Verse 2]
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true

[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
Incase you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

[Breakdown]
Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more

Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

And we'll never be worlds apart

And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)

'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown

And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)

Another day another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart

[Chorus]
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you

[Verse 2]
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?
Theres to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I
[Chorus]
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas, without you

They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl

As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me

My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone

Little bag niggas don’t associate with ‘em
Wanna be a god but still on the true religion
Can’t come, nope
Put my hand up on the boat
You are not from the land I swim from
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Please don’t insult my intelligence
My mindset is greater than your relevance
I, couldn't get a hold of your name there
Can't stay long 'cause the money's on hold and I gotta pick it up like daycare
You know I gotta pick it up I don't play fair

Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know

Es que odio amarte tanto

Uh-huh, uh-huh (good girl gone bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
[Verse 3: Rihanna]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me

So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart

And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share

Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard

And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

Just hold me close boy ‘cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me

Take a breath, take it deep
""Calm yourself,"" he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes""
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost
[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

And you can see my heart
Said I’m terrified

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size 10 in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
Stupid in love

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is ""You Idiot""
That's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me ""Let go, he is not the one.""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist, on repeatedly trying, to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
No, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing
[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Verse 2]
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Bridge]
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (cry, cry, cry)

[Break]
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (you'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life

264,Masquerade,"Masquerade LyricsWearing a smile
Fighting my tears
Covering it all
Hiding a disguise
Hiding my fears
Put up a wall

But underneath it all
The girl you love is gone
I've already let go
But I put on a show
That's all that I know
But I'm waiting to fall

It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade
Its all that I know
So comfortable
I wanna prove you wrong
Even though I need more
Blue skies and rainbows
But the song goes on

If I took off the mask
It wouldn't be because you asked
What you'll be forced to see
It's all been make believe
I'm not who you want me to be

It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade

Lying on my bed, letting these tears come streaming down
But you're going away, and taking your lies with you into the ground
I've been screaming inside, I can finally let it out
The truth is heard now
Face to face
Time to put an end to this
It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade
It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masqueradeEmbed"

But something's missing

What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out

But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Verse 2]
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

Every time I walk out the door

With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh
[Verse 2]
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So, I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three

Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

308,Unfaithful (Hamel Radio Edit),"Unfaithful (Hamel Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
(They shake the spot, she's just another case)

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
We done forever

Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Pump it up, put it on, tell me, what you waitin' for?
Feel it deep in my soul, now it's out of control
I can't take it anymore
[Chorus]
Bring it back again, play my track again
Keep it hot for me
Make my body move, it's all up to you
What's it gonna be?
Play my joint again, play my jam
And send this one out to me
Bring it back again
It's a fact I need somethin' that I'm gonna feel

Oh-woah-oh-no (Bring it back)

Don't you understand, I don't want a slow jam
I wanna feel the hottest beat

It's my joint, it's my jam, play the record again
It's the one that turns me on
It's alright, it's okay
I don't care if you play it until the night is done

Bring it back again, play my track again
Keep it hot for me
Make my body move, it's all up to you
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)
Play my joint again, play my jam

My California king
My California king
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got

Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

Why couldn't I be the one?

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Bridge]
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?Embed"

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)

This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)

It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three

No time to think, my turn to go

Sometimes it helps""

That he’s here, means he’s never lost

I'm really digging your performance
You're absolutely gorgeous
And your ego is enormous

You got my hands up in the air
Your girl's watching me g go crazy but I don't care
I welcome her to stare
Cuz I've been noticing you checking me out from way up there

Somebody ring the alarm
And make some room on the stage
Cuz I'm 'bout to perform

For My Favorite DJ (3X)
You make those sexy faces
And you scratch all the right places
Your energy is so contagious
You push my buttons and you turn all of my pages

I'm bout to comes out of my clothes
I'm soaking wet and I don't carе if everybody knows
A little tipsy I supposе
You've got a private invitation to see me exposed

Somebody ring the alarm
And make some room on the stage
