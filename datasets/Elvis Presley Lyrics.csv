The prison band was there and they began to wail

6,Are You Lonesome Tonight?,"Are You Lonesome Tonight? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Spoken]
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
[Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?5Embed"
7,In the Ghetto,"In the Ghetto Lyrics[Verse 1]
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Bridge]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way?
[Verse 2]
Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Bridge]
Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

[Verse 3]
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And as her young man dies (In the ghetto)
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
[Outro]
And his mama cries
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

8,If I Can Dream,"If I Can Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]

Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why

[Verse 2]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear

[Bridge]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)
[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

And more, much more than this

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that

Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

[Verse 7]
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not

And not the words of one who kneels

Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

To let you go, never knowing what went wrong

And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you in the cold Kentucky rain

Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, ""Yes, she's been here,"" but their memory wasn't clear
""Was it yesterday? No, wait, the day before""

I finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon?""
As we drove on thru the rain, as he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you

75,I Believe,"I Believe Lyrics[Verse 1]
I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows

I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe, I believe

I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word

[Chorus]
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe (believe, I believe)
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe (I believe)1Embed"

A very old friend came by today
'Cause he was telling everyone in town
Of the love that he just found
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

He talked and talked, and I heard him say
That she had the longest, blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone, but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry?

This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally?

You pull into a drive-in, you find a place to park
You hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark

Out of the car long hair, oowee
You're coming with me-the local police

84,Guitar Man,"Guitar Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went hunting them nightclubs
Just looking for a place to play
Well, I thought my picking would set them on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

[Verse 2]
Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis
I run out to money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking out some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar
Making music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
""There ain't no room around here for a guitar man""
""We don't need a guitar man, son""
[Verse 3]
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile, Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed them what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man
Show them, son

[Verse 4]
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Digging the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leading that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't you know, it's that swinging little guitar man

[Verse 5]
Well, I came a long way from the car wash
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really have not got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm going to get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I'm a swinging little Guitar manEmbed"

But Winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
Oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time
She'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see
When I hear the Sunday bells ringing in the morning
I remember crying when she used to sing
Oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared
About the way we learned to live
And if we said our prayers

You know I kept the family bible
With a rose that she saved inside
It was pressed between the pages
Like it had found a place to hide

Oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way
We bring them every Mother's Day
And put them on her grave
Oh, mama liked the roses Mmmm

I'm her ideal, her hearts desire
Under that ice she's burning like fire
She'd like to cuddle up to me
She's playing hard to get
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet

The gentleman has savoir-faire
As much as an elephant or a bear
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo to visit his kin
He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet
The lady's got a crush on me
The gentleman's crazy obviously
The lady's dying to be kissed
The gentleman needs a psychiatrist
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet

She's falling fast she's on the skids
Both of his heads are flipping their lids
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
Will someone tell this Romeo
I'm not his Juliet
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet

She wants me
Like poison ivy
Needs me
Like a hole in the head
Everyone can see she's got it bad
He's mad!
The gentleman is an egotist
I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist
He's one man I could learn to hate
How's about having dinner at eight
I'd rather dine with Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
Oh yes she loves me
Dig that shrinking violet
Oh she really loves me
Here's one gal you'll never get
She lo- lo- loves me
Would you like to make a bet
I said the lady loves me

And rode into Raleigh
And on across Caroline

Halfway across Alabama
And that hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Riding across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Just to help me get to Houston Town

He held twelve bright stars in his right hand
Well his eyes flashed fire like the burning sun
Old John got scared and wanted to run
Well he wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go
Cause he felt the gospel cutting like a two-edged sword
And he heard a voice that said John, you take a look
And read what you see and then you write it in a book

And he saw twelve angels in the east
And there were twelve angels in the west

Twelve angels in the north
Twelve angels in the south

Four squared wide

When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

[Verse 2]
I remember the time
At the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
[Verse 3]
As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor
Looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

[Verse 4]
With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

[Verse 5]
He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend
That a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep, he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home1Embed"

Some of y'all never been down South too much
I'm going to tell you a little story, so you'll understand what I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks something like a turnip green
Everybody calls it polk salad
Now that's polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
She'd go out in the evenings and pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper, because that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

[Verse 1]
Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
[Chorus]
Polk Salad Annie
Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on the chain-gang
A mean, vicious woman

[Verse 2]
Every day before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad
And carry it home in a tow sack

[Chorus]
Polk Salad Annie
Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on the chain-gang
A wretched, spiteful, straight razor toting woman
Lord, have mercy

[Bridge]
Sock a little polk salad to me
(You know a need a real mess of it)

[Verse 3]
Her daddy was lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck patch

Polk Salad Annie
Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on the chain-gang

Before it gets too late

Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay here just the same

Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell

As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow

And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre

I see a change as come in to our lives
It's not the way that it used to be
And it's not too late to realize our mistake
We're just not right for each other

Love has slipped away left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we share
Of times we thought we cared for each other

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

Pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotized
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feelin' warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do was stand there paralyzed

When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbing you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do was stand there paralyzed

Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing every day, ooh
Ever since that day you came my way, ooh
You made my life for me just one big happy game

You held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In front of preacher you said ""I do""

All I could do was stand there paralyzed

180,Gentle On My Mind,"Gentle On My Mind LyricsIt's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk, mmm
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

It's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line

That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
(Together walking)
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
(Between us)
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' in the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Crackin' caldron in some train yard
(Some train yard)
My beard a rustlin'
Cold towel, and a dirty hat
Pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mindEmbed"

Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know, Lord, I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
I've climbed them all one by one

Ooh, this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
[Verse 2]
My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Ooh, this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me

Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love and love again

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share
We share together

Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me

A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine

And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

236,Woman Without Love,"Woman Without Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Her eyes tell the story so well
She tries hard to hide
So little expected
Too often neglected
A woman stripped of her pride

[Verse 2]
Always so careful not to cry
Until I fall asleep
And there in the silence
She lies with a tear on her cheek

[Bridge]
The thought comes to mind
That I've failed somehow
For things I can't quite recall
A man without love is only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all

She knows I don't love her
Although Heaven knows I've tried
Her reason for living
Is to go right on giving
The one thing that she's been denied

Without any warning
In the wee hours of the morning
She cries
The hurt deep inside she tries so to hide
Is beginning to show in her eyes

And a thought comes to mind that I've relive sometimes
For here it I can't quite recall

[Outro]
That a man without love's only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all
Yeah, a man without love's only half a man
But a woman is nothing at allEmbed"

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now my love
Now that it's over

Here comes the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die

Came to dwell among the lowly such as I
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On Mount Calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am I?

Who am I that the King would bleed and die for
Who am I that he would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why he ever loved me so
But to an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am I?
[Verse 2]
When I'm reminded of his words
I'll leave him never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve God's only son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am I?

But to an old rugged cross he'd go for, who am I?Embed"

If she's not real then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality

But they only helped our love grow
And we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled with envy
Or stray from the one that you hold

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know
That I would fly away with you

That she'll only break my heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

[Verse 1]
When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Now it's over
[Verse 2]
If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh, there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over

[Verse 3]
So I turn my back
I turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I set my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
Now it's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

And that ain't right

Holding on to daddy's thumb just as tightly as he can hold
And it's hearin' people say he looks a lot like his daddy
These things are a poor man's gold

It's the twinkle in the eyes of the gray haired old man we call grandpa
Tellin' tales to the kids that get taller every time there told
And it's knowin' that for a while he's no longer lonely
These things are a poor man's gold

It's the smell of honeysuckle in the springtime it's the silence of a freshly fallin snow
It's the sound of children laughing in the sunshine
It's a crisp autum night with a million stars all aglow
And it's the sweet sleepy sound of your warm gentle breathing

As you cling to me in the night to keep away the cold
And it's the softness of your body there in the darkness
These things are a poor man's gold
Honey theses precious things are a poor man's goldEmbed"

The cornet player hit a note that's flat
The trombone hit him while the poor cat sat

She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldn't sit down so we danced all night

Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd get kicked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy, I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks

[Verse 3]
My knees are weak, my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fellEmbed"

409,My Little Friend,"My Little Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
My warped and worried mind resorts
To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about
A pretty girl I used to know
But wouldn't know if we met face to face
And defying every logic known
I wish the time machine could take me back again
To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout
Referring to her only as my little friend

[Verse 2]
Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away
A child has grown into a woman of the world
I assume this knowing that she knew so much of life
At such a tender age
I learned from her the whispered things
The big boys at the pool hall talk about
The thrill and disappointment
Fear and shame that first love brings
But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend
[Verse 3]
The fragrance of the green grass
Mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
The moonlight night I kissed and cried
And swore I'd never touch another girl
But time moved fast and I moved on
And I loved others time and time again
But with each time I thought of her
And always gave a little more
Assembled love and remembrance for my little friend

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friendEmbed"
410,It’s Only Love,"It’s Only Love Lyrics[Verse]
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
But I just can't get enough

From the distance of my mind
Clock that's ringing says it's time
Wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality

[Chorus]
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
It's only love, there must be something else for me girl
[Verse]
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day

[Chorus]
It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong, my mind's hanging on
It's only love, but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and my pride, and just throw it aside
It's only love

It's only love, it's only love, it's only love
It's only love

411,The Walls Have Ears,"The Walls Have Ears Lyrics[Verse 1]
The walls have ears
Ears that hear each little sound you make
Every time you stamp, throw a lamp
And every cup and dish you break

[Chorus]
But they can't hear a kiss
Or two arms that hold you tight
So come on, baby
Don't fight tonight

[Verse 2]
The walls have ears
Better think before you fling that shoe
If you part my hair with a chair
They'll spread the news to Timbuktu
[Chorus]
But they can't hear a kiss
Or two arms that hold you tight
So come on, baby
Don't fight tonight

[Bridge]
Jets can fly, fast and high
Rockets can go even faster
But they can't catch or even match
Sound traveling through plaster

[Verse 1]
The walls have ears
Ears that hear each little sound you make
Every time you stamp, throw a lamp
And every cup and dish you break

[Chorus]
But they can't hear a kiss
Or two arms that hold you tight
So come on, baby
Don't fight tonight
Just dim the light
Don't fight tonightEmbed"

Whenever storm clouds gather
We call on him to light our darkest day
Why must it be that only when we're lonely
And hopes are dim, we call on him

Why don't we call on him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank him while we may

We call on him
When no one else will answer
We ask of him a reason to go on
When our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow
Filled to the brim, we call on him

Why don't we call on him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank him while we mayEmbed"

Before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay

I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start
But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart

Where the pavement never grows

And the women all were fast

She's rolling out at last

Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

Because I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be

Like you can a freight train

And the cool grass for my bed

With the stars in the dawn's grey light

They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

He said son, oh you know we won't forget
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet

I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail

His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night

They're dating and they're acting like kids again

Counting my beads alone

It was just about to this time of the year
Looks like it's gonna be snowy weather
How I wish that you could be here

But it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams

In the distance I hear sleigh bells ringing
The holly is so pretty this year
And the carol that somebody's singing
Reminds me of our christmas last yearEmbed"
468,Stop Look And Listen,"Stop Look And Listen Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was a little bitty boy
Sitting on my papa's knee
I still remember every word my papa said to me
Now boy if you ever meet
A pretty woman walking down the street

[Chorus]
You'd better
Stop real still, look both ways
Listen or you'll get in trouble

[Verse 2]
When you see her go strutting by
Giving you that evil eye
And she's got a kind of dreamy look
Just enough to get you shook
Now boy don't you lose your head
You pay attention what your papa said
[Chorus]

[Break]
All right !

[Verse 3]
She'll drive you crazy with the way she walks
She'll drive you crazy with the way she talks
And you'll think you're going to lose your mind
Cause that pretty woman looks so fine
And the very first thing you'll know
You'll be telling her you love her so

You'd better stop real stillEmbed"

475,Life,"Life Lyrics[Verse]
Somewhere out in empty space
Long before the human race
Something stirred
A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the Word
Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness
Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life
Everlasting life

Well, creatures come from out of sight
Daylight came from in the night
And all was good
Life became a master plan
Love produced a perfect man
That understood
The image of the Maker's word
Worshiped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life
Everlasting life
Oh, the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow
Well, the fires of Hell began to burn
And so He sent his chosen son
To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well He showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life
Everlasting life
For life is love
And love is lifeEmbed"

Fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
Time rolls back the shadows of your mind

Loneliness is a darkness' first companion
Spend the night alone and faith may bend

Now the day can push away the night
Dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
Hope creates a foothold for the light

Walking the streets till past midnight
Tramping roads, trails and lanes
Scaling cliffs fields and plains
Searching till the early dawn

Riding trucks, bikes and skis
Sailing lakes and brooks and seas
Driving wagons, cars and jeeps
Walking stilts in ten foot leaps
Searching till the early dawn

For that long legged girl with the short dress on
And everywhere I go she's been and gone
She's fine, it's just too bad she's the travelling kind
So fine, I just can't rest till I make her mine

Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Searching high, searching low

But how much more time can you borrow?

I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel

But people let me tell you it was rock and roll

Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood

I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll

Some thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it, Lord, it takes me home

Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to those country songs
While I was in the back room rocking on

I hear those desert drums, and when nighttime comes
Then I'll make love the way I planned
To say the least, go on, go east young man

Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad

Death and taxes to be exact
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare

Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky
The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me how can you stay away

Far too long have I stayed apart
From this land that I love and divide my heart
Now, now I know I must go
Where the hills say don't stay away
Where the hills say don't stay awayEmbed"

Of Susan when she tried

[Verse 2]
No there's never been a woman
Who could make me weak inside
And give me what I needed
Like Susan when she tried

It gets worse in the summer
When the nights are hot and long
And it's bad in December
When they play those Christmas songs
So if you ask me and I don't tell you
Bet your sweet bottom dollar I lied
Cause there's never been one better
Than Susan when she triedEmbed"

I remember how your eyes used to light up
Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid

[Verse 2]
I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down

[Verse 3]
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed
I had things more important to do
[Verse 4]
I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down

[Verse 5]
Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me
If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me

[Verse 6]
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
But if a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming downEmbed"

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away

And I'm keeping you for my own

Heads I win or tails I lose
I bet my heart to win your love
The day you kissed me, good luck was with me
And I thank my lucky stars above

[Chorus]
I'm not the kind to play for fun
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
The loser has to pay the score
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
[Chorus]
I'm not the kind to play for fun
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
The loser has to pay the score
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
Yeah he lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever moreEmbed"

It's written in the stars, your destiny is cast
And that hourglass runs too fast, no doubt
For the sands of time are running out

Live each day, for happiness can't wait
And love while you may, but heed the hand of fate
If the finger points, it's too late, no doubt
For the sands of time are running out
But the man who turns and escapes somehow

Is the wisest of men
And to such a man I'd bowEmbed"

Somebody waiting who's right for me

So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gonna find that rainbow beyond the bend
Beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
Somebody waiting who's right for me

So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gonna find that rainbow beyond the bend

I'm on the right track for lots of kissing
So that old greenback, I won't be missing
All the greatest things in life are free

Cash or credit, it doesn't matter
Long as my bank books keep growing fatter
Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money, I do

[Verse 3]
Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worrying about their income tax
Why waste time on high financing, I'd rather spend it on good romancing
What if my pockets are empty as can be
Who needs money, not me
Tell me about it

Some folks save it, some folks lend it
But as for me I want to spend it
Give me some green and my skies will be blue
Who needs money, I do

Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
Who needs money, not me

When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep

Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
Who needs money, not me

What do you want

[Verse 7]
I want a big yacht, I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two
Who needs money, I do
[Verse 8]
Any time some girl starts flirting
Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality
Tell me, who needs money not me

Poverty's the only thing that money cannot buy
So rich or poor it pays to have M-O-N-E-Y

[Outro]
A gal who's tender, that's what I love

It's legal tender, I want a pile of
Just let my liquid assets overflow

You can't take it with you when you go
So, who needs money

That lovely, lovely money

Who needs money, not meEmbed"

Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man

There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery

You can feel your knees growing weak
Every single boy feels the height of joy
When he climbs that mountain peak

I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery

626,Where Do I Go From Here?,"Where Do I Go From Here? LyricsIf I knew the way I'd go back home
The countryside has changed so much I'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of the bridges that were burned once they were crossed

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Get back home where my childhood dreams and wishes still are none of my regrets
Go back to a place where I can figure all the odds
Have a fighting chance to lose the blues and win my share of bets

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from hereEmbed"

Pedro the bull was a killer
King of the bullfighter ringer
He'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
And have matador stew for his dinner

He heard the crowd shouting ""Ole""
But he met his master that day

And it was true love at first sight
Her red cape was waving but Pedro was shaking
He wanted to date her that night

First time the love bug had bitten
He once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten

The people were starting to hiss
But Pedro just wanted to kiss

The bullfighter was a lady
And Pedro he liked what he saw
He floated on air with a rose in his hair
As he waltzed with that sweet matador

His fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
It's hanging right over her door

And the warm wind crawls through the castle walls
And the night folk wakes as the warm wind calls

On the back of a dancing whale
While the mermaids sing to the shell they bring
And the dragon leads with his sweeping tail

Brings the children on to a beach that's bright and new
And the night folk know as the castles grow
They will play once more as the children do

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago




[Verse 3]
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy-o, don't you dare
He give me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'
[Outro]
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when we kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burnEmbed"

Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away
Well, every time I hear
Her sweet voice on the telephone
Then I know I just can't stand it another day
I'm gonna call right back
And tell her that I'm coming home and stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stayEmbed"

745,Ghost Riders in the Sky,"Ghost Riders in the Sky LyricsAn old cowboy went ridin' out
On a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies
And up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry:
Yippee-yi-yo, yippee-yi-ya

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on hear their cry:

As the riders loped on by him
He heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell
Ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies

Yippee-yi-yo, yippee-yi-yaEmbed"

As she walked home from shcool
And then her deathbed soon claimed her
It made us so sad and so blue

Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both and go

I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry

Take care of little brother
Tell him I'm gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left
Then she closed eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darlin
On that bright and peaceful shore

I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high

Oh mommy and daddy dont cry

Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks something like a turnip green
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
She'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper, because that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman

And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack

Because the mama was working on the chain-gang

Lord, you know, she thinks I still care

[Verse 3]
Well, if she's happy thinking I still need her
Yeah, let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh how could she ever be so foolish
Tell me where did she get, lord such an idea
[Break]
Yeah, oh lord

[Verse 4]
Just because I asked a friend about her
And you know, just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because, lord I saw her and went to pieces
Lord, you know, she thinks I, lord, still care

You know, she thinks I, I still care

[Outro]
Lord, she thinks I still care
Oh no she thinks I still careEmbed"

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
Because Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland

Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true
Oh, why
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell mе why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
Wе're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream come true, oh
Right now, oh  let it come true right now

'Cause he can handle an armored tank
Just like a kiddy car

So sleep little soldier, don't you cry

Doobie, doobie, doobie, doo-doo

You won't believe it's true
Did you know your daddy, Big Boots
Once wore little boots like you?

Once wore little boots like you
Once wore little boots like youEmbed"
